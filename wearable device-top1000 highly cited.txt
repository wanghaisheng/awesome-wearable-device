These systems are based on monitoring different kinds of biological signals released by human beings through saliva, urine, breathing and epidemic skin perspiration. However, the development and commercialization of wearable healthcare equipment is still at a relatively slow pace, because the construction method of ordinary semiconductor equipment is no longer applicable. Despite these challenges, advances in materials science, chemical analysis techniques, equipment design and manufacturing methods have laid the foundation for a completely different wearable technology, which has led to the continuous evolution of wearable systems over the years. Hence, a comprehensive review in this field is required for the rational design and development of wearable systems for healthcare applications. In this regard, we like to summarize all the major components in wearable healthcare systems and discuss the progress made in this field, as well as the challenges that lie ahead. We think that this review will have a great implication for the wider scientific community which will contribute to the rational design of human health monitoring devices and accelerate the development of flexible electronics.									154	5	0	0	23	0	154			0927-796X	1879-212X											2020-05-14	WOS:000528779100002

However, there is a saying "wearable is not wearable" because the current market-available wearable sensors are largely bulky and rigid, leading to uncomfortable wearing experience, motion artefacts, and poor data accuracy. This has aroused a world-wide intensive research quest for novel materials, with the aim of fabricating next-generation ultra-lightweight and soft wearable devices. Such disruptive second-skin-like biosensing technologies may enable a paradigm shift from current wearable 1.0 to future wearable 2.0 products. Here, the state-of-the-art progress made in the key phases for future wearable technology, namely, wear -> sense -> communicate -> analyze -> interpret -> decide, is summarized. Without a doubt, materials innovation is the key, which is the main focus of the discussion. In addition, emphasis is also given to wearable energy, multicomponent integration, and wireless communication.									185	15	0	0	21	0	192			0935-9648	1521-4095											2019-11-25	WOS:000496029700001	31721340

Smart flexible sensing electronics are components crucial in endowing health monitoring systems with the capability of real-time tracking of physiological signals. These signals are closely associated with body conditions, such as heart rate, wrist pulse, body temperature, blood/intraocular pressure and blood/sweat bio-information. Monitoring such physiological signals provides a convenient and non-invasive way for disease diagnoses and health assessments. This Review summarizes the recent progress of flexible sensing electronics for their use in wearable/attachable health monitoring systems. Meanwhile, we present an overview of different materials and configurations for flexible sensors, including piezo-resistive, piezo-electrical, capacitive, and field effect transistor based devices, and analyze the working principles in monitoring physiological signals. In addition, the future perspectives of wearable healthcare systems and the technical demands on their commercialization are briefly discussed.									501	37	0	0	33	0	514			1613-6810	1613-6829											2017-07-05	WOS:000404553100001	28306196

Other than the pursuit of high energy density of secondary batteries, an alternative approach recently drawing intensive attention from the research community, is to integrate energy-generation and energy-storage devices into self-charging power systems (SCPSs), so that the scavenged energy can be simultaneously stored for sustainable power supply. This paper reviews recent developments in SCPSs with the integration of various energy-harvesting devices (including piezoelectric nanogenerators, triboelectric nanogenerators, solar cells, and thermoelectric nanogenerators) and energy-storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. SCPSs with multiple energy-harvesting devices are also included. Emphasis is placed on integrated flexible or wearable SCPSs. Remaining challenges and perspectives are also examined to suggest how to bring the appealing SCPSs into practical applications in the near future.									226	10	0	0	12	0	226			1613-6810	1613-6829											2018-12-28	WOS:000419325600013	29194960

This Review examines the building blocks of wearable devices, including the substrate materials as well as the sensing, decision-making and power modules.Wearable devices provide an alternative pathway to clinical diagnostics by exploiting various physical, chemical and biological sensors to mine physiological (biophysical and/or biochemical) information in real time (preferably, continuously) and in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner. These sensors can be worn in the form of glasses, jewellery, face masks, wristwatches, fitness bands, tattoo-like devices, bandages or other patches, and textiles. Wearables such as smartwatches have already proved their capability for the early detection and monitoring of the progression and treatment of various diseases, such as COVID-19 and Parkinson disease, through biophysical signals. Next-generation wearable sensors that enable the multimodal and/or multiplexed measurement of physical parameters and biochemical markers in real time and continuously could be a transformative technology for diagnostics, allowing for high-resolution and time-resolved historical recording of the health status of an individual. In this Review, we examine the building blocks of such wearable sensors, including the substrate materials, sensing mechanisms, power modules and decision-making units, by reflecting on the recent developments in the materials, engineering and data science of these components. Finally, we synthesize current trends in the field to provide predictions for the future trajectory of wearable sensors.									55	0	0	0	3	0	55			2058-8437												2022-07-29	WOS:000828914600001	35910814

Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, and only articles published in the English language up to May 2019 were considered. Studies were excluded if they did not identify the device used and if they did not examine the validity or reliability of the device. Studies involving the general population and all special populations were included. We operationalized validity as criterion validity (as compared with other measures) and construct validity (degree to which the device is measuring what it claims). Reliability measures focused on intradevice and interdevice reliability.Results: We included 158 publications examining nine different commercial wearable device brands. Fitbit was by far the most studied brand. In laboratory-based settings, Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Samsung appeared to measure steps accurately. Heart rate measurement was more variable, with Apple Watch and Garmin being the most accurate and Fitbit tending toward underestimation. For energy expenditure, no brand was accurate. We also examined validity between devices within a specific brand.Conclusions: Commercial wearable devices are accurate for measuring steps and heart rate in laboratory-based settings, but this varies by the manufacturer and device type. Devices are constantly being upgraded and redesigned to new models, suggesting the need for more current reviews and research.									139	0	0	0	23	0	139			2291-5222												2020-09-08	WOS:000591971900001	32897239

Recent advances show the development of integrated, mechanically flexible and multiplexed sensor systems with on-site circuitry for signal processing and wireless data transmission. When compared with single-analyte sensors, such devices provide an opportunity to more accurately analyse analytes that are dependent on other parameters (such as sweat rate and pH) by improving calibration from in situ real-time analysis, while maintaining a lightweight and wearable design. Important health conditions can be monitored and on-demand regulating drugs can be delivered using integrated wearable systems but require correlation verification between sweat and blood measurements using in vivo validation tests before any clinical application can be considered.

The growing needs for wearable health monitoring systems call for a high-performance real-time UV sensor to prevent skin diseases caused by excess UV exposure. To this end, here a novel self-powered p-CuZnS/n-TiO2 UV photodetector (PD) with high performance is successfully developed (responsivity of 2.54 mA W-1 at 0 V toward 300 nm). Moreover, by effectively replacing the Ti foil with a thin Ti wire for the anodization process, the conventional planar rigid device is artfully turned into a fiber-shaped flexible and wearable one. The fiber-shaped device shows an outstanding responsivity of 640 A W-1, external quantum efficiency of 2.3 x 10(5)%, and photocurrent of approximate to 4 mA at 3 V, exceeding those of most current UV PDs. Its ultrahigh photocurrent enables it to be easily integrated with commercial electronics to function as a real-time monitor system. Thus, the first real-time wearable UV radiation sensor that reads out ambient UV power density and transmits data to smart phones via wifi is demonstrated. This work not only presents a promising wearable health monitor, but also provides a general strategy for designing and fabricating smart wearable electronic devices.									303	23	0	0	10	0	309			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-12-28	WOS:000448786000015	30160338

Here, we report an ultrahigh stretchable and wearable device fabricated from dry-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers. Stretching the highly oriented (NT fibers grown on a flexible substrate (Ecoflex) induces a constant decrease in the conductive pathways and contact areas between nanotubes depending on the stretching distance; this enables (NT fibers to behave as highly sensitive strain sensors. Owing to its unique structure and mechanism, this device can be stretched by over 900% while retaining high sensitivity, responsiveness, and durability. Furthermore, the device with biaxially oriented (NT fiber arrays shows independent cross-sensitivity, which facilitates simultaneous measurement of strains along multiple axes.

However, there are remaining challenges in terms of polychromatic configuration, electroluminescence efficiency and/or multidirectional deformability. Here we present ultra-thin, wearable colloidal quantum dot light-emitting diode arrays utilizing the intaglio transfer printing technique, which allows the alignment of red-green-blue pixels with high resolutions up to 2,460 pixels per inch. This technique is readily scalable and adaptable for low-voltage-driven pixelated white quantum dot light-emitting diodes and electronic tattoos, showing the best electroluminescence performance (14,000 cd m(-2) at 7 V) among the wearable light-emitting diodes reported up to date. The device performance is stable on flat, curved and convoluted surfaces under mechanical deformations such as bending, crumpling and wrinkling. These deformable device arrays highlight new possibilities for integrating high-definition full-colour displays in wearable electronics.									451	29	0	0	24	0	463			2041-1723												2015-05-01	WOS:000355533700008	25971194

SHC escalates healthcare management with increased efficiency, convenience, and personalization, via use of wearable devices and connectivity, to access information with rapid responses. Wearable devices are equipped with multiple sensors to identify a person's movements. The unlabeled data acquired from these sensors are directly trained in the cloud servers, which require vast memory and high computational costs. To overcome this limitation in SHC, we propose a federated learning-based person movement identification (FL-PMI). The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is leveraged in FL-PMI for auto-labeling the unlabeled data. The data are then trained using federated learning (FL), in which the edge servers allow the parameters alone to pass on the cloud, rather than passing vast amounts of sensor data. Finally, the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) in FL-PMI classifies the data for various processes associated with the SHC.

Among a broad range of layered TMDs, atomically thin layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been of particular interest, due to its exceptional electronic properties, including tunable bandgap and charge carrier mobility. MoS2 atomic layers can be used as a channel or a gate dielectric for fabricating atomically thin field-effect transistors (FETs) for electronic and optoelectronic devices. This review briefly introduces the processing and spectroscopic characterization of large-area MoS2 atomically thin layers. The review summarizes the different strategies in enhancing the charge carrier mobility and switching speed of MoS2 FETs by integrating high-K dielectrics, encapsulating layers, and other 2D van der Waals layered materials into flexible MoS2 device structures. The photoluminescence (PL) of MoS2 atomic layers has, after chemical treatment, been dramatically improved to near-unity quantum yield. Ultraflexible and wearable active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AM-OLED) displays and wafer-scale flexible resistive random-access memory (RRAM) arrays have been assembled using flexible MoS2 transistors. The review discusses the overall recent progress made in developing MoS2 based flexible FETs, OLED displays, nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices, piezoelectric nanogenerators (PNGs), and sensors for wearable electronic and optoelectronic devices. Finally, it outlines the perspectives and tremendous opportunities offered by a large family of atomically thin-layered TMDs.									206	11	0	0	5	0	209			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-04-15	WOS:000462950600002	30830744

Therefore, hydrogels are soft and moisturized, with mechanical structures and physical properties similar to those of human tissue. Such hydrogels have a potential to turn the microscale gap between wearable devices and human skin into a tissue-like space. Here, we present material and device strategies to form a tissue-like, quasi-solid interface between wearable bioelectronics and human skin. The key material is an ultrathin type of functionalized hydrogel that shows unusual features of high mass-permeability and low impedance. The functionalized hydrogel acted as a liquid electrolyte on the skin and formed an extremely conformal and low-impedance interface for wearable electrochemical biosensors and electrical stimulators. Furthermore, its porous structure and ultrathin thickness facilitated the efficient transport of target molecules through the interface. Therefore, this functionalized hydrogel can maximize the performance of various wearable bioelectronics.									77	5	0	0	10	0	78			2375-2548												2021-05-13	WOS:000648332700003	33962955

Fiber-shaped batteries display a unique 1D architecture with the merits of superior flexibility, miniaturization potential, adaptability to deformation, and compatibility with the traditional textile industry, which are especially advantageous for wearable applications. In the recent research frontier in the field of fiber-shaped batteries, in addition to higher performance, advances in multifunctional, scalable, and integrable systems are also the main themes. However, many difficulties exist, including difficult encapsulation and installation of separators, high internal resistance, and poor durability. Herein, the design principles (e.g., electrode preparation and battery assembly) and device performance (e.g., electrochemical and mechanical properties) of fiber-shaped batteries, including lithium-based batteries, zinc-based batteries, and some other representative systems, are summarized, with a focus on multifunctional devices with environmental adaptability, stimuli-responsive properties, and scalability up to energy textiles, with the hope of enlightening future research directions.

Next-generation noninvasive healthcare devices, such as flexible multifunctional sensor sheets designed to be worn on skin, are considered to be highly suitable candidates for continuous real-time health monitoring. For healthcare applications, acquiring data on the chemical state of the body, alongside physical characteristics such as body temperature and activity, are extremely important for predicting and identifying potential health conditions. To record these data, in this study, we developed a wearable, flexible sweat chemical sensor sheet for pH measurement, consisting of an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) integrated with a flexible temperature sensor: we intend to use this device as the foundation of a fully integrated, wearable healthcare patch in the future. After characterizing the performance, mechanical flexibility, and stability of the sensor, real-time measurements of sweat pH and skin temperature are successfully conducted through skin contact. This flexible integrated device has the potential to be developed into a chemical sensor for sweat for applications in healthcare and sports.									234	6	0	0	23	0	236			2379-3694												2017-03-01	WOS:000397701200017	28723207

In particular, integration of flexible electronic devices with clothes, glasses, watches, and skin will bring new opportunities beyond what can be imagined by current inflexible counterparts. Although considerable progresses have been seen for wearable electronics, lithium rechargeable batteries, the power sources of the devices, do not keep pace with such progresses due to tenuous Mechanical stabilities, causing them to remain as the limiting elements in the entire technology. Herein, we revisit the key components of the battery (current collector, binder, and separator) and replace them with the materials that support robust mechanical endurance of the battery. The final full-cells in the forms of clothes and watchstraps exhibited comparable electrochemical performance to those of conventional metal foil-based cells even under severe folding-unfolding motions simulating actual wearing conditions. Furthermore, the wearable textile battery was integrated with flexible and lightweight solar cells on the battery pouch to enable convenient solar-charging capabilities.									348	21	1	0	27	0	360			1530-6984	1530-6992											2013-11-01	WOS:000327111700119	24164580

Such toxicity characteristic makes them difficult to power future wearable electronic devices. Now an environmentally friendly and highly safe rechargeable battery, based on a pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO) cathode and zinc anode in mild aqueous electrolyte is presented. The PTO-cathode shows a high specific capacity (336 mAh g(-1)) for Zn2+ storage with fast kinetics and high reversibility. Thus, the PTO//Zn full cell exhibits a high energy density (186.7Wh kg(-1)), supercapacitor-like power behavior and long-term lifespan (over 1000 cycles). Moreover, a belt-shaped PTO//Zn battery with robust mechanical durability and remarkable flexibility is first fabricated to clarify its potential application in wearable electronic devices.									346	24	0	0	16	0	350			1433-7851	1521-3773											2018-12-28	WOS:000442846300045	30019809

However, their continuous operation is often limited by traditional battery technologies with a limited lifespan, creating a significant challenge for their development. Thus, it is highly desirable to harvest biomechanical energies from human motion for self-powered bio-integrated functional devices. Piezoelectric energy harvesters are ideal candidates to achieve this goal by converting biomechanical energy to electric energy. Because of their applications on soft and highly deformable tissues of the human body, these devices also need to be mechanically flexible and stretchable, thus posing a significant challenge. Effective methods to address the challenge include the exploration of new stretchable piezoelectric materials (e.g., hybrid composite material) and stretchable structures (e.g., buckled shapes, serpentine mesh layouts, kirigami designs, among others). This review presents an overview of the recent developments in new intrinsically stretchable piezoelectric materials and rigid inorganic piezoelectric materials with novel stretchable structures for flexible and stretchable piezoelectric sensors and energy harvesters. Following the discussion of theoretical modeling of the piezoelectric materials to convert mechanical deformations into electrical signals, the representative applications of stretchable piezoelectric materials and structures in wearable and implantable devices are briefly summarized. The present limitations and future research directions of flexible and stretchable piezoelectric devices are then discussed.									152	7	0	0	16	0	156			0956-5663	1873-4235											2020-11-15	WOS:000574928500005	32905930

Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to assess effects on physical activity and health-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess whether the effects differed by interventions and cancer characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.Results: Thirty-five trials were included (breast cancer, n = 15, 43%). Intervention durations ranged between 4 weeks and 1 year. Most trials (n = 25, 71%) involved pedometer-based physical activity interventions. Seven (20%) involved Fitbit-based interventions, and 3 (9%) involved other wearable physical activity trackers (e.g., Polar, Garmin). Compared to usual care, wearable devices had moderate-to-large effects (SMD range 0.54-0.87, p < 0.001) on moderate-intensity physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, total physical activity, and daily steps. Compared to usual care, those in the intervention had higher quality of life, aerobic fitness, physical function, and reduced fatigue (SMD range = 0.18-0.66, all p < 0.05).Conclusion: Wearable physical activity trackers and pedometers are effective tools that increase physical activity and improve health-related outcomes in individuals with cancer. Identifying how these devices can be implemented for longer-term use with other intervention components remains an area for future research.									18	0	0	0	4	0	18			2095-2546	2213-2961											2022-04-20	WOS:000778670600007	34314878

However, a number of critical technological challenges including selectivity, stability of (bio)recognition, efficient sample handling, invasiveness, and mechanical compliance to increase user comfort must still be overcome to successfully bring devices closer to commercial applications. We introduce the integration of an electrochemical transistor and a tailor-made synthetic and biomimetic polymeric membrane, which acts as a molecular memory layer facilitating the stable and selective molecular recognition of the human stress hormone cortisol. The sensor and a laser-patterned micro capillary channel array are integrated in a wearable sweat diagnostics platform, providing accurate sweat acquisition and precise sample delivery to the sensor interface.

Bioelectronics is a fast-growing interdisciplinary research field that involves interfacing biomaterials with electronics, covering an array of biodevices, encompassing biofuel cells, biosensors, ingestibles, and implantables. In particular, enzyme-based bioelectronics, built on diverse biocatalytic reactions, offers distinct advantages and represents a centerpiece of wearable biodevices. Such wearable bioelectronic devices predominately rely on oxidoreductase enzymes and have already demonstrated considerable promise for on-body applications ranging from highly selective noninvasive biomarker monitoring to epidermal energy harvesting. These systems can thus greatly increase the analytical capability of wearable devices from the ubiquitous monitoring of mobility and vital signs, toward the noninvasive analysis of important chemical biomarkers. Wearable enzyme electrodes offer exciting opportunities to a variety of areas, spanning from healthcare, sport, to the environment or defense. These include real-time noninvasive detection of biomarkers in biofluids (such as sweat, saliva, interstitial fluid and tears), and the monitoring of environmental pollutants and security threats in the immediate surrounding of the wearer. Furthermore, the interface of enzymes with conducting flexible electrode materials can be exploited for developing biofuel cells, which rely on the bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of biological fuels, such as lactate or glucose, for energy harvesting applications. Crucial for such successful application of enzymatic bioelectronics is deep knowledge of enzyme electron-transfer kinetics, enzyme stability, and enzyme immobilization strategies. Such understanding is critical for establishing efficient electrical contacting between the redox enzymes and the conducting electrode supports, which is of fundamental interest for the development of robust and efficient bioelectronic platforms. Furthermore, stretchable and flexible bioelectronic platforms, with mechanical properties similar to those of biological tissues, are essential for handling the rigors of on-body operation. As such, special attention must be given to changes in the behavior of enzymes due to the uncontrolled conditions of on-body operation (including diverse outdoor activities and different biofluids), for maintaining the attractive performance that these bioelectronics devices display in controlled laboratory settings. Therefore, a focus of this Account is on interfacing biocatalytic layers onto wearable electronic devices for creating efficient and stable on-body electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cells. With proper attention to key challenges and by leveraging the advantages of biocatalysis, electrochemistry, and flexible electronics, wearable bioelectronic devices could have a tremendous impact on diverse biomedical, fitness, and defense fields.									168	3	0	0	29	0	165			0001-4842	1520-4898											2018-12-28	WOS:000451245900025	30398344

A new class of devices with various functionality and amenability for the human body is essential. These new conceptual devices are likely to be a set of various functional devices such as displays, sensors, batteries, etc., which have quite different working conditions, on or in the human body. In these aspects, electronic textiles seem to be a highly suitable possibility, due to the unique characteristics of textiles such as being light weight and flexible and their inherent warmth and the property to conform. Therefore, e-textiles have evolved into fiber-based electronic apparel or body attachable types in order to foster significant industrialization of the key components with adaptable formats. Although the advances are noteworthy, their electrical performance and device features are still unsatisfactory for consumer level e-textile systems. To solve these issues, innovative structural and material designs, and novel processing technologies have been introduced into e-textile systems. Recently reported and significantly developed functional materials and devices are summarized, including their enhanced optoelectrical and mechanical properties. Furthermore, the remaining challenges are discussed, and effective strategies to facilitate the full realization of e-textile systems are suggested.									361	10	0	0	20	0	363			1613-6810	1613-6829											2018-12-28	WOS:000422789800015	29205836

MXene (Ti3C2Tx), which is a new two-dimensional material with remarkable properties, has been widely applied in wearable electronics. However, it remains a challenge to prepare MXene based smart textile that possesses multifunctional wearable sensing applications and can also keep MXene from oxidizing. Here, we fabricated a waterproof and breathable smart textile by construction of a multiple core-shell structure, i.e., MXene decoration onto the polydopamine (PDA) modified elastic textile followed by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating. MXene wrapping the fibers formed the conductive network, while PDMS could not only protect the MXene from oxidation but also endow the textile with superhydrophobicity and thus corrosion resistance. The smart textile possessed outstanding and durable photo thermal and electro-thermal conversion performance. More importantly, the textile electronic exhibited sensitive and stable strain sensing performance and temperature sensing capacity with a high thermal coefficient of resistance. Evidently, such smart textile device is highly promising for application in next generation all-in-one wearable electronics.									200	13	0	0	22	0	201			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-01-08	WOS:000600990000004

In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various HAR datasets. For deep learning, improvements in performance have to heavily rely on increasing model size or capacity to scale to larger and larger datasets, which inevitably leads to the increase of operations. A high number of operations in deep leaning increases computational cost and is not suitable for real-time HAR using mobile and wearable sensors. Though shallow learning techniques often are lightweight, they could not achieve good performance. Therefore, deep learning methods that can balance the trade-off between accuracy and computation cost is highly needed, which to our knowledge has seldom been researched. In this paper, we for the first time propose a computation efficient CNN using conditionally parametrized convolution for real-time HAR on mobile and wearable devices. We evaluate the proposed method on four public benchmark HAR datasets consisting of WISDM dataset, PAMAP2 dataset, UNIMIB-SHAR dataset, and OPPORTUNITY dataset, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without compromising computation cost. Various ablation experiments are performed to show how such a network with large capacity is clearly preferable to baseline while requiring a similar amount of operations. The method can be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing deep HAR architectures and easily deployed onto mobile and wearable devices for real-time HAR applications.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1530-437X	1558-1748											2022-04-05	WOS:000770054800114

Over the last decade, the human body has been considered as a good source of heat to harvest electrical energy through wearable thermoelectric generators. It may become an alternative power generation technique compared to other conventional ones used for many wearable devices. The wearable thermoelectric generator has potential to generate sufficient energy for any wireless sensor nodes (typically power requirements < mW).

It investigates the impact of each component of perceived benefit and risk on the perceived value of wearable devices, and explores how their attributes affect customers' perceived benefit. Partial least squares was employed to test the proposed model and corresponding hypotheses on data collected from 375 survey samples (273 potential and 102 actual users). The results show that perceived value is a clear antecedent of adoption intention. Perceived benefit including perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and social image seems to have a greater impact on perceived value than perceived risk. Specifically, a significant difference was observed between potential users and actual users. This study discusses a number of implications and contributes useful insights for researchers as well as practitioners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing wearable and transparent materials with healable function that can recover their original functionality after mechanical damage under mild and noninvasive repairing operation is thus imperative. Herein, we demonstrate that the incorporation of ultrasmall quantities of plasmonic silver nanoparticle (AgNP)@MXene nanosheet hybrids to serve as photothermal fillers in waterborne elastic polyurethane enables high transparency as well as effective light-triggered healing capabilities for wearable composite coatings. The AgNP@MXene hybrid functions as a highly effective photon captor, energy transformer, and molecular heater due to the amalgamation of (1) ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency, high thermal conductivity, and structural properties of MXene, (2) the outstanding plasmonic effect of AgNPs, and (3) the synergistic effects from their hybrids. The resulting wearable composite coating with ultralow loading of plasmonic AgNP@MXene hybrids (0.08 wt % or 0.024 vol %) can produce a significant temperature increase of similar to 111 +/- 2.6 degrees C after the application of 600 mW cm(-2) light irradiation for 5 min, while maintaining a high optical transmittance of,similar to 83% at a thickness of,similar to 60 mu m. This local temperature increase can rapidly heal the mechanical damage to the composite coating, with a healing efficiency above 97%.									180	9	0	0	24	0	180			1936-0851	1936-086X											2019-08-13	WOS:000477786400077	31244046

Playing a critical role as the power sources for independent electronic systems, energy harvesters with high flexibility or stretchability have been the focus of research efforts over the past decade. A large number of the flexible energy harvesters developed can only operate at very low strain level (approximate to 0.1%), and their limited flexibility impedes their application in wearable or stretchable electronics. Here, the development of highly flexible and stretchable (stretchability >15% strain) energy harvesters is reviewed with emphasis on strategies of materials synthesis, device fabrication, and integration schemes for enhanced flexibility and stretchability. Due to their particular potential applications in wearable and stretchable electronics, energy-harvesting devices based on piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, thermoelectricity, and dielectric elastomers have been largely developed and the progress is summarized. The challenges and opportunities of assembly and integration of energy harvesters into stretchable systems are also discussed.									349	21	3	0	19	0	360			0935-9648	1521-4095											2016-12-07	WOS:000392725200001	27677428

However, achieving accurate continuous blood pressure wave monitoring based on arterial pulse waves remains challenging, because the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and their related blood pressure waves is unclear. To address this, the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves is first elucidated via theoretical, simulation, and experimental analysis of these dynamics. Based on this correlation, the authors develop a wireless wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring system, with better portability than conventional systems that are based on the pulse wave velocity between multiple sensors. They explore the feasibility of achieving wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring without motion artifacts, using a single piezoelectric sensor. These findings eliminate the controversy over the arterial pulse wave piezoelectric response, and can potentially be used to develop a portable wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring device for the early prevention and daily control of hypertension.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-03-26	WOS:000768303700001	35285098

Wearable electronic systems require a material that is strong to ensure durability and stability, and a wide range of strain to expand their applications. However, it is still challenging to manufacture fibrous materials with simultaneously high mechanical strength and the tensile property. Herein, the ultra-robust (approximate to 17.6 MPa) and extensible (approximate to 700%) conducting microfibers are developed and demonstrated their applications in fabricating fibrous mechanical sensors. The mechanical sensor shows high sensitivity in detecting strains that have high strain resolution and a large detection range (from 0.0075% to 400%) simultaneously. Moreover, low frequency vibrations between 0 and 40 Hz are also detected, which covers most tremors that occur in the human body. As a further step, a wearable and smart health-monitoring system has been developed using the fibrous mechanical sensor, which is capable of monitoring health-related physiological signals, including muscle movement, body tremor, wrist pulse, respiration, gesture, and six body postures to predict and diagnose diseases, which will promote the wearable telemedicine technology.									41	1	0	0	2	0	41			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-04-24	WOS:000781031300001	35306697

In this regard, energy harvesting technologies have immensely invested in organic and polymeric semiconducting materials due to their large-area synthesis, low cost, low toxicity, high flexibility, and tunable electronic properties. For example, electrically conductive p-conjugated polymers have been investigated in various thermoelectric technologies for producing stretchable, wearable, and light-weight thermoelectric devices that can harvest energy from a temperature gradient and produce electricity with no pollution or moving parts. In this review we initially provide a general overview of the thermoelectric principles and conductive polymer characteristics, followed by the recent progress in their application in flexible and wearable thermoelectric devices. We also evaluate new advances in manufacturing hybrids of p-conjugated polymers with other polymers, inorganic materials, or carbon nanostructures, and their applications in body energy harvesting and smart cooling.

Despite this potential, a device for in situ treatment of fatal seizures using pharmaceutical methods has not been developed yet. Here, we present a novel treatment system for neurological medical emergencies, such as status epilepticus, a fatal epileptic condition that requires immediate treatment, using a soft implantable drug delivery device (SID). The SID is integrated wirelessly with wearable devices for monitoring electroencephalography signals and triggering subcutaneous drug release through wireless voltage induction. Because of the wireless integration, bulky rigid components such as sensors, batteries, and electronic circuits can be moved from the SID to wearables, and thus, the mechanical softness and miniaturization of the SID are achieved. The efficacy of the prompt treatment could be demonstrated with animal experiments in vivo, in which brain damages were reduced and survival rates were increased.									60	2	0	0	7	0	61			2375-2548												2021-02-03	WOS:000605159200023	33523849

Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user personal data. However, there are two critical challenges. First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Wearable activity recognition experiments and real Parkinson's disease auxiliary diagnosis application have evaluated that FedHealth is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. FedHealth is general and extensible in many healthcare applications.									217	7	0	0	9	0	223			1541-1672	1941-1294											2020-07-01	WOS:000564262600009

However, success in wearable sensors has been a mix of both progress and setbacks. Most of commercial progress has been in smart adaptation of existing mechanical, electrical and optical methods of measuring the body. This adaptation has involved innovations in how to miniaturize sensing technologies, how to make them conformal and flexible, and in the development of companion software that increases the value of the measured data. However, chemical sensing modalities have experienced greater challenges in commercial adoption, especially for non-invasive chemical sensors. There have also been significant challenges in making significant fundamental improvements to existing mechanical, electrical, and optical sensing modalities, especially in improving their specificity of detection. Many of these challenges can be understood by appreciating the body's surface (skin) as more of an information barrier than as an information source. With a deeper understanding of the fundamental challenges faced for wearable sensors and of the state-of-the-art for wearable sensor technology, the roadmap becomes clearer for creating the next generation of innovations and breakthroughs.									574	20	0	0	113	0	577			1473-0197	1473-0189											2018-01-21	WOS:000423016500001	29182185

In addition, the technology readiness and acceptance model (TRAM) will be used to investigate consumers' intention to use sports wearable devices (for simplicity, sports wearable devices will be simplified to the term sports wearables).Design/methodology/approach Convenience sampling was conducted from Korean consumers (n=247). Data were analyzed by partial least squares-structural equation modeling using SmartPLS 3.0.Findings The results found that positive TR has a positive influence on perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU), and negative TR had a negative influence on PEOU and PU. PEOU had a positive influence on perceived usefulness (PU). Both PEOU and PU led to intention to use sports wearable devices. Also, the multi-group analysis found a positive correlation between TR and PEOU for especially male users.Originality/value The findings of this study provide a better understanding of consumers' behavioral intent to use sports wearables. Particularly, it also provides evidence that the TRAM is an appropriate framework for predicting users' intention to use sports wearables. This study also stresses the important role of TR in consumers' psychological processes leading up to the actual use of novel sports wearables.									82	0	0	0	1	1	83			1464-6668	2515-7841											2019-02-15	WOS:000457643100006

Conventional devices adapted for thermal therapy including heat packs and wraps have often caused discomfort to their wearers because of their rigidity and heavy weight. In our study, we developed a soft, thin, and stretchable heater by using a nanocomposite of silver nanowires and a thermoplastic elastomer. A ligand exchange reaction enabled the formation of a highly conductive and homogeneous nanocomposite. By patterning the nanocomposite with serpentine-mesh structures, conformal lamination of devices on curvilinear joints and effective heat transfer even during motion were achieved. The combination of homogeneous conductive elastomer, stretchable design, and a custom-designed electronic band created a novel wearable system for long-term, continuous articular thermotherapy.									387	15	0	0	30	0	394			1936-0851	1936-086X											2015-06-01	WOS:000356988500106	26027637

We present a unique approach that demonstrates mechanically robust, intrinsically safe silver-zinc batteries. This approach uses current collectors with enhanced mechanical design, such as helical springs and serpentines, as a structural support and backbone for all battery components. We show wire-shaped batteries based on helical band springs that are resilient to fatigue and retain electrochemical performance over 17,000 flexure cycles at a 0.5-cm bending radius. Serpentine-shaped batteries can be stretched with tunable degree and directionality while maintaining their specific capacity. Finally, the batteries are integrated, as a wearable device, with a photovoltaic module that enables recharging of the batteries.									272	13	0	0	17	0	277			2375-2548												2017-06-01	WOS:000406370700006	28630897

The device represents the first system integrating an iontophoretic pilocarpine delivery system around the inlet channels of epidermal polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device for sweat collection and analysis. The freshly generated sweat is naturally pumped into the fluidic inlet without the need of exercising. Soft skin-mounted systems, incorporating non-invasive, on-demand sweat sampling/analysis interfaces for tracking target biomarkers, are in urgent need. Existing skin conformal microfluidic-based sensors for continuous monitoring of target sweat biomarkers rely on assays during intense physical exercising. This work demonstrates the first example of combining sweat stimulation, through transdermal pilocarpine delivery, with sample collection through a microfluidic channel for real-time electrochemical monitoring of sweat glucose, in a fully integrated soft and flexible multiplexed device which eliminates the need of exercising. The on-body operational performance and layout of the device were optimized considering the fluid dynamics and evaluated for detecting sweat glucose in several volunteers. Furthermore, the microfluidic monitoring device was integrated with a real-time wireless data transmission system using a flexible electronic board PCB conformal with the body. The new microfluidic platform paves the way to real-time non-invasive monitoring of biomarkers in stimulated sweat samples for diverse healthcare and wellness applications.									20	0	0	0	5	0	19			1618-2642	1618-2650											2022-01-17	WOS:000741213100001	35015101

Despite the growth in the field, major challenges in relation to sweat metrics remain to be addressed. These challenges include sweat rate monitoring for its complex relation with sweat compositions and sweat sampling for sweat dynamics studies. In this work, we present a flexible microfluidic sweat sensing patch that enhances real-time electrochemical sensing and sweat rate analysis via sweat sampling. The device contains a spiral-patterned microfluidic component that is embedded with ion-selective sensors and an electrical impedance-based sweat rate sensor on a flexible plastic substrate. The patch is enabled to autonomously perform sweat analysis by interfacing the sensing component with a printed circuit board that is capable of on-site signal conditioning, analysis, and transmission. Progressive sweat flow in the microfluidic device, governed by the pressure induced by the secreted sweat, enhances sweat sampling and electrochemical detection via a defined sweat collection chamber and a directed sweat route. The characteristic of the sweat rate sensor is validated through a theoretical simulation, and the precision and accuracy of the flow rate is verified with a commercial syringe pump and a Macroduct sweat collector. On-body simultaneous monitoring of ion (H+, Na+, K+, Cl-) concentration and sweat rate is also demonstrated for sensor functionality. This sweat sensing patch provides an integrated platform for a comprehensive sweat secretion analysis and facilitates physiological and clinical investigations by closely monitoring interrelated sweat parameters.									218	6	0	0	60	0	221			2379-3694												2018-12-28	WOS:000433635300007	29741360

Therefore, walking recovery is one of the main priorities for counteracting sedentary lifestyle, reducing secondary health conditions and restoring legged mobility. At present, wearable powered lower-limb exoskeletons are emerging as a revolutionary technology for robotic gait rehabilitation. This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview on wearable lower-limb exoskeletons for people with neuromuscular impairments, addressing the following three questions: (1) what is the current technological status of wearable lower-limb exoskeletons for gait rehabilitation?, (2) what is the methodology used in the clinical validations of wearable lower-limb exoskeletons?, and (3) what are the benefits and current evidence on clinical efficacy of wearable lower-limb exoskeletons? We analyzed 87 clinical studies focusing on both device technology (e.g., actuators, sensors, structure) and clinical aspects (e.g., training protocol, outcome measures, patient impairments), and make available the database with all the compiled information. The results of the literature survey reveal that wearable exoskeletons have potential for a number of applications including early rehabilitation, promoting physical exercise, and carrying out daily living activities both at home and the community. Likewise, wearable exoskeletons may improve mobility and independence in non-ambulatory people, and may reduce secondary health conditions related to sedentariness, with all the advantages that this entails. However, the use of this technology is still limited by heavy and bulky devices, which require supervision and the use of walking aids. In addition, evidence supporting their benefits is still limited to short-intervention trials with few participants and diversity among their clinical protocols. Wearable lower-limb exoskeletons for gait rehabilitation are still in their early stages of development and randomized control trials are needed to demonstrate their clinical efficacy.									81	7	0	0	12	0	85				1743-0003											2021-03-14	WOS:000616632000003	33526065

Their thin, soft, and deformable features allow intimate and long-term integration with biotissues, which enables continuous, high-fidelity, and sometimes large-area cardiac monitoring on the skin and/or heart surface. In addition to monitoring, intimate contact is also crucial for high-precision therapies. Combined with tissue engineering, soft bioelectronics have also demonstrated the capability to repair damaged cardiac tissues. This review highlights the recent advances in wearable and implantable devices based on flexible and stretchable electronics for cardiovascular monitoring and therapy. First, wearable/implantable soft bioelectronics for cardiovascular monitoring (e.g., the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation level) are reviewed. Then, advances in cardiovascular therapy based on soft bioelectronics (e.g., mesh pacing, ablation, robotic sleeves, and electronic stents) are discussed. Finally, device-assisted tissue engineering therapy (e.g., functional electronic scaffolds and in vitro cardiac platforms) is discussed.									259	16	0	0	28	0	263			1616-301X	1616-3028											2019-05-09	WOS:000471333600009

Here, we report on a Schottky-barrier indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistor operating in the deep subthreshold regime (i.e., near the OFF state) at low supply voltages (<1 volt) and ultralow power (<1 nanowatt). By using a Schottky-barrier at the source and drain contacts, the current-voltage characteristics of the transistor were virtually channel-length independent with an infinite output resistance. It exhibited high intrinsic gain (>400) that was both bias and geometry independent. The transistor reported here is useful for sensor interface circuits in wearable devices where high current sensitivity and ultralow power are vital for battery-less operation.									170	3	0	0	13	0	172			0036-8075	1095-9203											2016-10-21	WOS:000387777100038	27846559

Flexible supercapacitors (also known as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors) have attracted increasing attention for advanced energy storage because of their high capability, long cycle life, low cost, and easy fabrication. Carbon nanomaterials, including 1D carbon nanotubes, 2D graphene, and 3D mesoporous carbon, are promising as electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors due to their extremely large surface area, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, and high electrochemical stability. Much effort has been devoted to developing flexible, carbon-based, all-solid-state supercapacitors with different structure/performance characteristics, including conventional planar, ultrathin in-plane, wearable fiber-shaped, stretchable, transparent, and integrated devices with aesthetic appeal. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of recent progress towards the development of advanced flexible supercapacitors based on carbon nanomaterials.

However, with the mushroom of the fifth generation wireless systems (5G) and the Internet of Things (IoT), it is a great challenge for powering the ubiquitous distributed devices, because the battery production and high overhead maintenance may bring more carbon emissions. Here, we present wearable biosensors for real-time sweat analysis and body motion capture based on stretchable fiber-based triboelectric nanogenerators (F-TENG). The F-TENG is made of stretchable conductive fiber (Ecoflex coating with polyaniline (PANI)) and varnished wires. Based on the coupling effect of triboelectric effect and enzymatic reaction (surface-triboelectric coupling effect), the wearable biosensors can not only precisely sense the motion states, but also detect glucose, creatinine and lactate acid in sweat in real-time. Importantly, the wearable devices can self-drive without any external power source and the response against glucose, creatinine and lactate acid can be up to 103%, 125% and 38%, respectively. On this basis, applications in biosensing and wireless communication have been demonstrated. This work exhibits a prospective potential application of F-TENG in IoT for diverse use.									43	1	0	0	3	0	43			0956-5663	1873-4235											2022-07-10	WOS:000820283300007	35219020

Soft, flexible, and stretchable electronic devices provide a novel platform to interface with soft tissues for robotic feedback and control, regenerative medicine, and continuous health monitoring. Here, we introduce the term "lab-on-skin" to describe a set of electronic devices that have physical properties, such as thickness, thermal mass, elastic modulus, and water-vapor permeability, which resemble those of the skin. These devices can conformally laminate on the epidermis to mitigate motion artifacts and mismatches in mechanical properties created by conventional, rigid electronics while simultaneously providing accurate, non-invasive, long-term, and continuous health monitoring. Recent progress in the design and fabrication of soft sensors with more advanced capabilities and enhanced reliability suggest an impending translation of these devices from the research lab to clinical environments. Regarding these advances, the first part of this manuscript reviews materials, design strategies, and powering systems used in soft electronics. Next, the paper provides an overview of applications of these devices in cardiology, dermatology, electrophysiology, and sweat diagnostics, with an emphasis on how these systems may replace conventional clinical tools. The review concludes with an outlook on current challenges and opportunities for future research directions in wearable health monitoring.									995	45	0	0	100	0	1006			1936-0851	1936-086X											2017-10-01	WOS:000413992800004	28901746

The printing technology will be instrumental in fabricating these novel electronic devices and circuits; however, attaining fully printed devices on ultra-flexible films in large areas has typically been a challenge. Here we report on fully printed organic thin-film transistor devices and circuits fabricated on 1-mm-thick parylene-C films with high field-effect mobility (1.0 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)) and fast operating speeds (about 1 ms) at low operating voltages. The devices were extremely light (2 gm (-2)) and exhibited excellent mechanical stability. The devices remained operational even under 50% compressive strain without significant changes in their performance. These results represent significant progress in the fabrication of fully printed organic thin-film transistor devices and circuits for use in unobtrusive electronic applications such as wearable sensors.									311	15	1	0	27	1	319			2041-1723												2014-08-15	WOS:000338838500003	24948030

However, low-energy density limits their development in the area of wearable high-energy density devices. How to enhance their energy densities while retaining their high-power densities is a critical challenge for yarn supercapacitor development. Here we propose a coaxial wet-spinning assembly approach to continuously spin polyelectrolyte-wrapped graphene/carbon nanotube core-sheath fibres, which are used directly as safe electrodes to assembly two-ply yarn supercapacitors. The yarn supercapacitors using liquid and solid electrolytes show ultra-high capacitances of 269 and 177 mF cm(-2) and energy densities of 5.91 and 3.84 mu Wh cm(-2), respectively. A cloth supercapacitor superior to commercial capacitor is further interwoven from two individual 40-cm-long coaxial fibres. The combination of scalable coaxial wet-spinning technology and excellent performance of yarn supercapacitors paves the way to wearable and safe electronics.									923	66	0	0	54	0	944			2041-1723												2014-05-01	WOS:000337367700002	24786366

Herein, a double-deck column filled with solid anticoagulant microspheres and Kevlar porous microspheres (KPMs, bilirubin adsorbents) was connected with the principle machine of wearable artificial liver (approximately 9 kg) to treat hyperbilirubinemia beagles for the first time. With the initial normal dose of heparin, the double-deck column could afford 3 h hemoperfusion in whole blood without thrombus formation. The removal efficiency of the double-deck column for total bilirubin (TBIL) was 31.4%. Interestingly, the excessive amounts of hepatocyte metabolites were also decreased by approximately 25%. The "anticoagulant + column " realized safe and effective whole blood hemoperfusion without the plasma separation system and heparin pump; however, the proposed principle machine of wearable artificial liver and "anticoagulant + column " cannot completely replace the bio-liver now. The intelligence of the device and the versatility of the adsorbent need to be improved; moreover, advanced experimental techniques need to be developed to validate the survival rates in animals. Overall, this study is a meaningful trial for the development of wearable artificial livers in the future.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2452-199X											2022-07-31	WOS:000830022800001	35846839

Given the limited capacity of energy storage devices, one promising solution is to integrate energy harvesting and storage materials to efficiently convert ambient mechanical energy to electricity for direct use or to store the harvested energy by electrochemical means. Here, a highly compact self-charging power unit is proposed by integrating triboelectric nanogenerator with MXene-based microsupercapacitors in a wearable and flexible harvester-storage module. The device can utilize and store the random energy from human activities in a standby mode and provide power to electronics when active. As a result, our microsupercapacitor delivers a capacitance of 23 mF/cm(2) with 95% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles, while the triboelectric nanogenerator exhibits a maximum output power of 7.8 mu W/cm(2).

In this work, inspired by the delamination structure of skin, an ultra-stretchable wearable hydrogel strain sensor with double layers is successfully prepared via in-situ polymerization of nucleobase-driven adhesive hydrogels on the surface of conductive tough hydrogels crosslinked by hydrophobic association. The hydrogel exhibits ultra-stretchability, high mechanical strength, and robust adhesion to various solid materials as well as skin. Furthermore, the hydrogel also exhibits high strain sensitivity and stability as a flexible and wearable strain sensor to detect large-range human motions and tiny physiological signals. Notably, the adhesive layer not only ensures a robust adhesion between the sensors and skin, but also protects skin from current harm when the hydrogels contact with skin directly, because of effectively blocking the current from the conductive tough layer. It is envisioned that the skin-inspired strategy would provide novel inspiration for the development of hydrogel strain sensors.									179	5	0	0	37	1	181			1385-8947	1873-3212											2019-03-01	WOS:000459009800002

Herein, we report the development of metal binder-free Ti3C2Tx MXene/graphene hybrid fibers by a scalable wet-spinning process. These hybrid fibers exhibit excellent mechanical and electrical properties for applications in flexible wearable gas sensors. The synergistic effects of electronic properties and gas-adsorption capabilities of MXene/graphene allow the created fibers to show high NH3 gas sensitivity at room temperature. The hybrid fibers exhibited significantly improved NH3 sensing response (Delta R/R-0 = 6.77%) compared with individual MXene and graphene. The hybrid fibers also showed excellent mechanical flexibility with a minimal fluctuation of resistance of +/- 0.2% and low noise resistance even after bending over 2000 cycles, enabling gas sensing during deformation. Furthermore, flexible MXene/graphene hybrid fibers were woven into a lab coat, demonstrating their high potential for wearable devices. We envisage that these exciting features of 2D hybrid materials will provide a novel pathway for designing next-generation portable wearable gas sensors.									172	12	0	0	11	0	176			1944-8244	1944-8252											2020-03-26	WOS:000518702300036	32040289

Here, we introduce the concept and design principles of e-textile microgrids by demonstrating a multi-module bioenergy microgrid system. Unlike earlier hybrid wearable systems, the presented e-textile microgrid relies solely on human activity to work synergistically, harvesting biochemical and biomechanical energy using sweat-based biofuel cells and triboelectric generators, and regulating the harvested energy via supercapacitors for high-power output. Through energy budgeting, the e-textile system can efficiently power liquid crystal displays continuously or a sweat sensor-electrochromic display system in pulsed sessions, with half the booting time and triple the runtime in a 10-min exercise session. Implementing "compatible form factors, commensurate performance, and complementary functionality" design principles, the flexible, textile-based bioenergy microgrid offers attractive prospects for the design and operation of efficient, sustainable, and autonomous wearable systems. Though energy-harvesting wearable systems have been reported in the literature, their system design imposes limitations that hinder their overall performance.

Significant progress has been achieved, particularly in device integration. Most wearable devices are integrated on thin-film polymer, however, less attention is paid to the sweat flow at human-device interfaces, which is of great significance for continuous real-time analysis and long-term skin comfort. Here, we reported a low-cost, freestanding and disposable highly integrated sensing paper (HIS paper) for real-time analysis of sweat. By using a simple printing process, the HIS paper combining hydrophobic protecting wax, conducting electrodes, and the incorporated MXene/methylene blue (Ti3C2Tx/MB) active materials was assembled. In particular, the printed paper was folded into a multi-layer structure, in which a reasonable designed three-dimensional (3D) sweat diffusion path is established by connecting the hydrophilic regions of each layer, providing efficient pathways for the collection and diffusion of sweat along the vertical direction of the folded HIS paper. More importantly, the independent 3D position of three-electrode facilitates the decoration and fixation of enzymes, as well as the accessibility of electrolytes. In addition, a dual-channel electrochemical sensor that can simultaneously detect glucose and lactate with sensitivity of 2.4 nA mu M-1 and 0.49 mu A mM(-1) respectively was produced based on the HIS paper. This HIS paper provides a miniaturized, low-cost and flexible solution for a range of biochemical platforms, including wearable bioelectronics.									65	2	0	0	11	0	64			0956-5663	1873-4235											2021-02-03	WOS:000605490200004	33250335

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning frame work where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.									237	4	0	0	13	1	241			2168-2194	2168-2208											2017-01-01	WOS:000395538500007	28026792

The introduction of a high level of wearability (bendability and stretchability) to tactile sensors can dramatically enhance their interfaces with the contact objects, providing chronically reliable functions. Therefore, the developed wearable tactile sensors are capable of conformably covering arbitrary curved surface over their stiff counterparts without incurring damage, emerging as a promising development direction toward the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Fundamental parameters of the wearable tactile sensors such as sensitivity and stretchability have experienced unprecedented advancement, owing to the progress of device fabrication techniques and material structural engineering. Moreover, novel smart materials and mechanically durable sensor design concepts endow these sensors with multi-functionality integration (e.g., simultaneous force, temperature and humidity detection, simultaneous pressure and strain discrimination) and stirring properties (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, self-healing, self-powering and visualization), further broadening the application scope of current wearable tactile sensors. Besides, it is desirable that a tactile sensor is compatible with a printing process that presents a new era of feasible wearable technology due to its large-area and high-throughput production capability. In addition to the development of sensors, packaging, and integration of the rest of the tactile device system (data memory, signal conversion, power supply, wireless transmission, feedback actuator, etc.) to build a wearable platform also emerge as major research frontiers in recent years. This review attempts to summarize the current state-of-the-art wearable tactile sensors concerning basic concepts, functional materials, sensing mechanism, promising applications, performance optimization strategies, multifunctional sensing, and system integration.

Deformability in such devices is mainly achieved by replacing the rigid materials in the device components with flexible nanomaterials and their assemblies (e.g., carbon nanotubes, silver nanowires, graphene, and quantum dots) or with intrinsically soft materials and their composites (e.g., polymers and elastomers). Downscaling the dimensions of the functional materials to the nanometer range dramatically decreases their flexural rigidity, and production of polymer/elastomer composites with functional nanomaterials provides light-emitting devices with flexibility and stretchability. Furthermore, monolithic integration of these light-emitting devices with deformable sensors furnishes the resulting display with various smart functions such as force/capacitive touch-based data input, personalized health monitoring, and interactive human-machine interfacing. These ultrathin, lightweight, and deformable smart optoelectronic devices have attracted widespread interest from materials scientists and device engineers.

In this review, we discuss recent exciting advances in the fabrication, performance enhancement, and applications of wearable textile strain sensors. We describe conventional and novel approaches to achieve textile strain sensors such as coating, conducting elastomeric fiber spinning, wrapping, coiling, coaxial fiber processing, and knitting. We also discuss how important performance parameters such as electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, sensitivity, sensing range, and stability are influenced by fabrication strategies to illustrate their effects on the sensing mechanism of textile sensors. We summarize the potential applications of textile sensors in structural health monitoring, wearable body movement measurements, data gloves, and entertainment.

There also remains a demand to develop a cost-effective human-machine interface to enhance the immersion during the long-term rehabilitation. Meanwhile, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) revealing its merits in both wearable electronics and IoT tends to be a possible solution. Herein, the authors present wearable TENG-based devices for gait analysis and waist motion capture to enhance the intelligence and performance of the lower-limb and waist rehabilitation. Four triboelectric sensors are equidistantly sewed onto a fabric belt to recognize the waist motion, enabling the real-time robotic manipulation and virtual game for immersion-enhanced waist training. The insole equipped with two TENG sensors is designed for walking status detection and a 98.4% identification accuracy for five different humans aiming at rehabilitation plan selection is achieved by leveraging machine learning technology to further analyze the signals. Through a lower-limb rehabilitation robot, the authors demonstrate that the sensory system performs well in user recognition, motion monitoring, as well as robot and gaming-aided training, showing its potential in IoT-based smart healthcare applications.									62	3	0	0	3	0	64				2198-3844											2021-11-26	WOS:000720285200001	34796695

However, the current preparation of flexible electrothermal devices mainly uses complex chemical deposition methods, which are interspersed with many environmentally unfriendly chemical wastewaters left by the preparation. In this study, we used water-free plasma treatment and magnetron sputtering techniques to prepare conductive silver/aramid fiber paper (Ag/AFP) flexible thin film heaters. The resultant Ag/AFP sputtered with 6 min exhibited fast thermal response and efficient Joule heating characteristics, reaching 120 degrees C in less than 6 s at an applied voltage of 1.2 V. Ag/AFP also provided excellent mechanical properties that could withstand bending, folding, and wrinkling without significant loss of electrical and thermal properties. When used in a thermotherapy patch, the Ag/AFP has unique synergistic antibacterial and thermal therapy. The results showed that magnetron sputtering combined with plasma treatment would provide a clean pathway for fabricating wearable textiles/devices.									27	0	0	0	7	0	27			2468-0230												2022-03-21	WOS:000764898400001

Many fi brous structures have been manufactured by well-established lost-effective textile processing technologies, normally at ambient conditions. The advancement of nanotechnology has made it feasible to build electronic devices directly on the surface or inside of single fi bers, which have typical thickness of several to tens microns. However, imparting electronic functions to porous, highly deformable and three-dimensional fi ber assemblies and maintaining them during wear represent great challenges from both views of fundamental understanding and practical implementation.

In this Review, Li and colleagues discuss the use of self-powered technology that harvests energy from the body and its ambient environment to power implantable and wearable CEDs.Cardiovascular electronic devices have enormous benefits for health and quality of life but the long-term operation of these implantable and wearable devices remains a huge challenge owing to the limited life of batteries, which increases the risk of device failure and causes uncertainty among patients. A possible approach to overcoming the challenge of limited battery life is to harvest energy from the body and its ambient environment, including biomechanical, solar, thermal and biochemical energy, so that the devices can be self-powered. This strategy could allow the development of advanced features for cardiovascular electronic devices, such as extended life, miniaturization to improve comfort and conformability, and functions that integrate with real-time data transmission, mobile data processing and smart power utilization. In this Review, we present an update on self-powered cardiovascular implantable electronic devices and wearable active sensors. We summarize the existing self-powered technologies and their fundamental features. We then review the current applications of self-powered electronic devices in the cardiovascular field, which have two main goals. The first is to harvest energy from the body as a sustainable power source for cardiovascular electronic devices, such as cardiac pacemakers. The second is to use self-powered devices with low power consumption and high performance as active sensors to monitor physiological signals (for example, for active endocardial monitoring).

The synergy between eco-friendly substrates and printed devices may lead to wearable sensors for decentralized analysis of pesticides in precision agriculture. In this paper we report on a wearable non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor capable of detecting carbamate and bipyridinium pesticides on the surface of agricultural and food samples. The low-cost devices (<US$ 0.08 per unit) contained threeelectrode systems deposited via screen-printing technology (SPE) on solution-blow spinning mats of poly (lactic acid) (PLA). The flexible PLA/SPE sensors can be used on flat, curved and irregular surfaces of leaves, vegetables and fruits. Detection was performed using differential pulse voltammetry and square wave voltammetry with detection limits of 43 and 57 nM for carbendazim and diquat, respectively. The wearable non-enzymatic sensor can discriminate and quantify carbendazim and diquat on apple and cabbage skins with no interference from other pesticides. The use of such wearable sensors may be extended to other agrochemicals, including with incorporation of active bio (sensing) layers for online monitoring of any type of agricultural products and foods.									20	0	0	0	5	0	20			0956-5663	1873-4235											2022-04-17	WOS:000774012200009	34922318

The macroscale performance of TENGs is determined by the multifaceted role of surface and material properties at the nanoscale, which must be understood for future TENG development. To achieve the desired TENG perfor-mance, various protocols for the fabrication and tuning of surfaces and materials are required. A particularly viable application area for TENGs is the energy source for relatively low powered wearable electronic sensors and devices via textile or fibrous TENGs. Therefore, this review focuses on recent advances in TENGs prepared by electrospinning from various material combinations and in terms of material design, function, and performance to obtain next generation nanofiber-based TENG devices. The remarkable physical and chemical characteristics of a wide range of electrospun nanostructured materials for achieving optimised TENG performance is discussed.

Since multi-sensor is defined by the presence of more than one model or channel, e.g. visual, audio, environmental and physiological signals. Hence, the fusion methods of multi-modality and multi-location sensors are proposed. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the stateoftheart on information fusion or deep learning, all of them only tackled one aspect of the sensor fusion applications, which leads to a lack of comprehensive understanding about it. Therefore, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of the fusion methods of wearable sensors. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of multi-sensor applications for human activity recognition, including those recently added to the field for unsupervised learning and transfer learning.

Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are of interest to make these wearables self-powered by making them rely entirely on the heat harvested from the human body. The challenge with using thermoelectrics on the human body is the large thermal resistances experienced at the skin/TEG and TEG/ambient interfaces. These parasitics can be potentially so large that they can dominate the device performance. Therefore, it is critical to have accurate models to predict the device performance considering material properties, module design and parasitics. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient, quasi three-dimensional TEG model and use this model to explore the design criteria for current state-of-the-art rigid TEG modules as well as prospective flexible modules for body wearable applications. We show the impact of the properties of the thermoelectric material, module design and dimensions, heat spreaders, filler material, heat sink and skin contact resistance on device performance. We also identify the significance of material thermal conductivity over the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity in improving the output power for wearable applications. For flexible TEGs, we identify the thermal conductivity of the filler material as one of the critical parameters that need to be taken into consideration for optimal performance. Finally, the model was used to design a custom TEG with improved material properties and device design. The measurements indicate a nearly 3x improvement in power output over a commercial TEG with similar area as successfully predicted by the calculations.									239	12	1	0	10	0	246			1754-5692	1754-5706											2016-07-06	WOS:000378244200019

Here, we report a highly stretchable and washable all-yarn-based self-charging knitting power textile that enables both biomechanical energy harvesting and simultaneously energy storing by hybridizing triboelectrical nanogenerator (TENG) and supercapacitor (SC) into one fabric. With the weft-knitting technique, the power textile is qualified with high elasticity, flexibility, and stretchability, which can adapt to complex mechanical deformations. The knitting TENG fabric is able to generate electric energy with a maximum instantaneous peak power density of similar to 85 mW center dot m(-2) and light up at least 124 light-emitting diodes. The all-solid-state symmetrical yarn SC exhibits lightweight, good capacitance, high flexibility, and excellent mechanical and long-term stability, which is suitable for wearable energy storage devices. The assembled knitting power textile is capable of sustainably driving wearable electronics (for example, a calculator or temperature-humidity meter) with energy converted from human motions. Our work provides more opportunities for stretchable multifunctional power sources and potential applications in wearable electronics.									341	14	0	0	12	0	344			1936-0851	1936-086X											2017-09-01	WOS:000411918200100	28901749

However, it is still a great challenge to apply thermal management for wearable devices using PCMs due to their solid rigidity and liquid leakage. Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to constructing flexible composite PCMs by physically blending bulk PCMs with different flexible polymers, design and fabrication of intrinsically flexible PCM films still remain unexplored. Herein, we report an intrinsically flexible PCM film with apparent solid-solid phase transition performance, outstanding self-support and shape-conformable property for wearable thermal management. Remarkably, the as-obtained PCM film behaves adjustable phase transition enthalpy and temperature in the region from about (5 to 60)degrees C, long-term cycling stability up to 1000 cycles, highly mechanical flexibility and remarkable shape tailorability and foldability. Notably, such flexible PCM films are easily integrated into wearable devices with a flexible graphene film as thermal source, revealing superior temperature control behaviors, together with unprecedented electro-thermal and photo-thermal energy conversion performance. The intrinsically flexible PCM film developed in this work is holding great potential for next-generation flexible thermal management electronics.Y									98	6	0	0	6	0	102			2405-8297												2021-01-05	WOS:000599502600008

Because of the large number of diabetic patients, many approaches for glucose measurement have been studied to enable continuous and accurate glucose level monitoring. Among them, electrochemical analysis is prominent because it is simple and quantitative. This technology has been incorporated into commercialized and research-level devices from simple test strips to wearable devices and implantable systems. Although directly monitoring blood glucose assures accurate information, the invasive needle-pinching step to collect blood often results in patients (particularly young patients) being reluctant to adopt the process. An implantable glucose sensor may avoid the burden of repeated blood collections, but it is quite invasive and requires periodic replacement of the sensor owing to biofouling and its short lifetime. Therefore, noninvasive methods to estimate blood glucose levels from tears, saliva, interstitial fluid (ISF), and sweat are currently being studied. This review discusses the evolution of enzyme-based electrochemical glucose sensors, including materials, device structures, fabrication processes, and system engineering. Furthermore, invasive and noninvasive blood glucose monitoring methods using various biofluids or blood are described, highlighting the recent progress in the development of enzyme-based glucose sensors and their integrated systems.									347	10	0	0	84	0	355			2192-2640	2192-2659											2018-04-25	WOS:000430804800003	29334198

However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross-linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non-covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi-functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m(-1), and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 degrees C-1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature.

In 2013, researchers finally broke this 'metabolic cost barrier'. We analyzed the literature through December 2019, and identified 23 studies that demonstrate exoskeleton designs that improved human walking and running economy beyond capable without a device. Here, we reviewed these studies and highlighted key innovations and techniques that enabled these devices to surpass the metabolic cost barrier and steadily improve user walking and running economy from 2013 to nearly 2020. These studies include, physiologically-informed targeting of lower-limb joints; use of off-board actuators to rapidly prototype exoskeleton controllers; mechatronic designs of both active and passive systems; and a renewed focus on human-exoskeleton interface design. Lastly, we highlight emerging trends that we anticipate will further augment wearable-device performance and pose the next grand challenges facing exoskeleton technology for augmenting human mobility.									133	3	1	0	21	0	137				1743-0003											2020-02-19	WOS:000517986900004	32075669

From these devices, intact health monitoring data were acquired for 5 consecutive days and analyzed on the degree of differences and the relationships of the monitoring measurements by the different devices.Results: The daily measurements by the different devices fluctuated greatly, and the coefficient of variation (CV) fluctuated in the range of 2-38% for the number of steps, 5-30% for distance, 19-112% for activity duration, 1-17% for total energy expenditure (EE), 22-100% for activity EE, 2-44% for sleep duration, and 35-117% for deep sleep duration. After integrating the measurement data of 25 days among the devices, the measurements of the number of steps (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=.89) and distance (ICC=.84) displayed excellent consistencies, followed by those of activity duration (ICC=.59) and the total EE (ICC=.59) and activity EE (ICC=.57). However, the measurements for sleep duration (ICC=.30) and deep sleep duration (ICC=.27) were poor. For most devices, there was a strong correlation between the number of steps and distance measurements (R-2 >.95), and for some devices, there was a strong correlation between activity duration measurements and EE measurements (R-2 >.7). A strong correlation was observed in the measurements of steps, distance and EE from smart watches and mobile phones of the same brand, Apple or Samsung (r >.88).Conclusions: Although wearable devices are developing rapidly, the current mainstream devices are only reliable in measuring the number of steps and distance, which can be used as health assessment indicators. However, the measurement consistencies of activity duration, EE, sleep quality, and so on, are still inadequate, which require further investigation and improved algorithms.									196	1	0	0	32	0	197			1438-8871												2017-03-01	WOS:000395832100002	28270382

A sustainable and wearable energy solution is highly desired , but challenges still remain in its development. Here, we report a high-performance wearable electricity generation approach by manipulating the relative permittivity of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). A compatible active carbon (AC)-doped polyvinylidene fluoride (AC@PVDF) composite film was invented with high relative permittivity and a specific surface area for wearable biomechanical energy harvesting.

However, motion artifacts and mechanical mismatches between conventional rigid electronic materials and soft skin often lead to substantial sensor errors during epidermal measurement. Because of its unique properties such as high flexibility and conformability, flexible electronics enables a natural interaction between electronics and the human body. In this Account, we summarize our recent studies on the design of flexible electronic devices and systems for physical and chemical monitoring. Material innovation, sensor design, device fabrication, system integration, and human studies employed toward continuous and noninvasive wearable sensing are discussed.A flexible electronic device typically contains several key components, including the substrate, the active layer, and the interface layer. The inorganic-nanomaterials-based active layer (prepared by a physical transfer or solution process) is shown to have good physicochemical properties, electron/hole mobility, and mechanical strength. Flexible electronics based on the printed and transferred active materials has shown great promise for physical sensing. For example, integrating a nanowire transistor array for the active matrix and a conductive pressure-sensitive rubber enables tactile pressure mapping; tactile-pressure-sensitive e-skin and organic light-emitting diodes can be integrated for instantaneous pressure visualization. Such printed sensors have been applied as wearable patches to monitor skin temperature, electrocardiograms, and human activities. In addition, liquid metals could serve as an attractive candidate for flexible electronics because of their excellent conductivity, flexibility, and stretchability. Liquid-metal-enabled electronics (based on liquid liquid heterojunctions and embedded microchannels) have been utilized to monitor a wide range of physiological parameters (e.g., pulse and temperature).Despite the rapid growth in wearable sensing technologies, there is an urgent need for the development of flexible devices that can capture molecular data from the human body to retrieve more insightful health information. We have developed a wearable and flexible sweat-sensing platform toward real-time multiplexed perspiration analysis. An integrated iontophoresis module on a wearable sweat sensor could enable autonomous and programmed sweat extraction. A microfluidics-based sensing system was demonstrated for sweat sampling, sensing, and sweat rate analysis. Roll-to-roll gravure printing allows for mass production of high-performance flexible chemical sensors at low cost. These wearable and flexible sweat sensors have shown great promise in dehydration monitoring, cystic fibrosis diagnosis, drug monitoring, and noninvasive glucose monitoring.Future work in this field should focus on designing robust wearable sensing systems to accurately collect data from the human body and on large-scale human studies to determine how the measured physical and chemical information relates to the individual's specific health conditions. Further research in these directions, along with the large sets of data collected via these wearable and flexible sensing technologies, will have a significant impact on future personalized healthcare.									502	27	0	0	44	0	513			0001-4842	1520-4898											2019-03-01	WOS:000462098100002	30767497

However, developing fiber-based fabric electronics to simulate human perceptual systems or even transcend the sensory capabilities of natural creatures is still a pivotal challenge. Herein, we present a Kevlar/MXene (KM) intelligent wearable fabric with multiple sensory capabilities using an ingenious strategy of continuous wet-spinning. The KM fibers can be washed, knitted, sewed, and fabricated into smart KM fabric sensory systems. An intelligent KM sensory mask is prepared to monitor human breathing in time to detect respiratory problems with high accuracy and portability. It provides an important reference for judging diseases and achieving remote diagnosis. Additionally, a smart temperature-responsive sensory glove is developed to help people make proper behavioral prejudgments and prevent potential injuries by sensing surrounding hazards beforehand. Moreover, this sensory system allows soft robotics to make a rough identification about the basic properties of unknown liquid molecules. Overall, by the virtue of the ultrafast responsiveness (90 ms), resilience (110 ms), and ultrasensitive capability in pressure responding, this KM sensory system offers a gentle approach for wireless detection in information encryption, transmission, and preservation by touching the sensory system with variable pressing time on the basis of the International Morse code principles, establishing a competitive and promising candidate for next generation wearable flexible fabric electronics.									75	6	0	0	3	0	76			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-06-19	WOS:000656994100065	33978397

High blood pressure is associated with many chronic disease conditions, and is a major source of mortality and morbidity around the world. For outpatient care as well as general health monitoring, there is great interest in being able to accurately and frequently measure BP outside of a clinical setting, using mobile or wearable devices. One possible solution is photoplethysmography (PPG), which is most commonly used in pulse oximetry in clinical settings for measuring oxygen saturation. PPG technology is becoming more readily available, inexpensive, convenient, and easily integrated into portable devices. Recent advances include the development of smartphones and wearable devices that collect pulse oximeter signals. In this article, we review (i) the state-of-the-art and the literature related to PPG signals collected by pulse oximeters, (ii) various theoretical approaches that have been adopted in PPG BP measurement studies, and (iii) the potential of PPG measurement devices as a wearable application. Past studies on changes in PPG signals and BP are highlighted, and the correlation between PPG signals and BP are discussed. We also review the combined use of features extracted from PPG and other physiological signals in estimating BP. Although the technology is not yet mature, it is anticipated that in the near future, accurate, continuous BP measurements may be available from mobile and wearable devices given their vast potential.									226	2	1	0	47	0	228			2398-6352												2019-06-26	WOS:000473496300001	31388564

Traditional pressure sensors cannot achieve both a high sensitivity and a large working range simultaneously, which results in their limited applications in wearable fields. There is an urgent need to develop a pressure sensor to make a breakthrough in both sensitivity and working range. In this paper, a graphene-paper pressure sensor that shows excellent performance in the range of 0-20 kPa is proposed. Compared to most reported graphene pressure sensors, this work realizes the optimization of sensitivity and working range, which is especially suitable for wearable applications. We also demonstrate that the pressure sensor can be applied in pulse detection, respiratory detection, voice recognition, as well as various intense motion detections.

It shows remarkable application potential in displays and informatics, robotics, sports, energy harvesting and storage, and medicine. As an indispensable part and the cornerstone of these devices, soft metal electrodes (SMEs) are of great significance. Compared with conventional physical processes such as vacuum thermal deposition and sputtering, chemical approaches for preparing SMEs show significant advantages in terms of scalability, low-cost, and compatibility with the soft materials and substrates used for the devices. This review article provides a detailed overview on how to chemically fabricate SMEs, including the material preparation, fabrication technologies, methods to characterize their key properties, and representative studies on different wearable applications.									198	12	0	0	7	1	198			0306-0012	1460-4744											2018-12-28	WOS:000437186000013	29722373

However, response variance between participants for fixed control strategies can be high, leading to the hypothesis that individualized controllers could further improve walking economy. Recent studies on human-in-the-loop (HIL) control optimization have elucidated several practical challenges, such as long experimental protocols and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we used Bayesian optimization-an algorithm well suited to optimizing noisy performance signals with very limited data-to identify the peak and offset timing of hip extension assistance that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking with a textile-based wearable device. Optimal peak and offset timing were found over an average of 21.4 +/- 1.0 min and reduced metabolic cost by 17.4 +/- 3.2% compared with walking without the device (mean +/- SEM), which represents an improvement of more than 60% on metabolic reduction compared with state-of-the-art devices that only assist hip extension. In addition, our results provide evidence for participant-specific metabolic distributions with respect to peak and offset timing and metabolic landscapes, lending support to the hypothesis that individualized control strategies can offer substantial benefits over fixed control strategies. These results also suggest that this method could have practical impact on improving the performance of wearable robotic devices.									282	8	0	0	31	0	286			2470-9476												2018-02-21	WOS:000441684800001	33141683

Currently, it is still a great challenge to fabricate strain sensors with high performance and good fit to the human body. In this work, we fabricated a close-fitting and wearable graphene textile strain sensor based on a graphene textile without polymer encapsulation. Graphene oxide acts as a colorant to dye the polyester fabric and is reduced at high temperature, which endows the graphene textile strain sensor with excellent performance. Compared with the previously reported strain sensors, our strain sensor exhibits a distinctive negative resistance variation with increasing strain. In addition, the sensor also demonstrates fascinating performance, including high sensitivity, long-term stability, and great comfort. Based on its superior performance, the graphene textile strain sensor can be knitted on clothing for detecting both subtle and large human motions, showing the tremendous potential for applications in wearable electronics.									349	17	0	0	20	0	352			1936-0851	1936-086X											2018-09-01	WOS:000445972400032	30134097

This paper presents a novel wearable TEG with 52 pairs of cubic-shaped thermoelectric legs to harvest human body heat. The thermoelectric legs are made of P-type and N-type Bi2Te3-based powder materials, and are connected electrically in series through soldering. The flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) with special holes is designed and used as substrate to enhance the flexibility of the TEG for wearable applications. The performances of the TEG, including the bulk thermoelectric legs, are characterized. The results show that the TEG can generate an open-circuit voltage of 37.2 mV at Delta T = 50 K, and the internal resistance of the TEG is quite low at a value of 1.8 Omega. Then the TEG was worn on a human wrist to harvest body heat and power a 3-axis miniaturized accelerometer for detection of body motion at Delta T = 18 K. The results demonstrate that the developed wearable TEG features high output performance and could be utilized for powering electronics and/or sensors by harvesting human body heat.									151	5	0	0	1	0	152			0306-2619	1872-9118											2018-12-28	WOS:000428974500056

Such devices typically use machine-learning models, either locally or externally, for gesture classification. However, most devices with local processing cannot offer training and updating of the machine-learning model during use, resulting in suboptimal performance under practical conditions. Here we report a wearable surface electromyography biosensing system that is based on a screen-printed, conformal electrode array and has in-sensor adaptive learning capabilities. Our system implements a neuro-inspired hyperdimensional computing algorithm locally for real-time gesture classification, as well as model training and updating under variable conditions such as different arm positions and sensor replacement. The system can classify 13 hand gestures with 97.12% accuracy for two participants when training with a single trial per gesture. A high accuracy (92.87%) is preserved on expanding to 21 gestures, and accuracy is recovered by 9.5% by implementing model updates in response to varying conditions, without additional computation on an external device.A surface electromyography biosensing system that is based on a screen-printed, conformal electrode array and has in-sensor adaptive learning capabilities can classify human gestures in real time and with high accuracy.									180	9	0	0	20	0	183			2520-1131												2021-01-12	WOS:000600818900001

Accuracy of wearable technologies has been a hotly debated topic in both the research and popular science literature. Currently, wearable technology companies are responsible for assessing and reporting the accuracy of their products, but little information about the evaluation method is made publicly available. Heart rate measurements from wearables are derived from photoplethysmography (PPG), an optical method for measuring changes in blood volume under the skin. Potential inaccuracies in PPG stem from three major areas, includes (1) diverse skin types, (2) motion artifacts, and (3) signal crossover. To date, no study has systematically explored the accuracy of wearables across the full range of skin tones. Here, we explored heart rate and PPG data from consumer- and research-grade wearables under multiple circumstances to test whether and to what extent these inaccuracies exist. We saw no statistically significant difference in accuracy across skin tones, but we saw significant differences between devices, and between activity types, notably, that absolute error during activity was, on average, 30% higher than during rest. Our conclusions indicate that different wearables are all reasonably accurate at resting and prolonged elevated heart rate, but that differences exist between devices in responding to changes in activity. This has implications for researchers, clinicians, and consumers in drawing study conclusions, combining study results, and making health-related decisions using these devices.									168	0	0	0	36	0	168			2398-6352												2020-02-10	WOS:000518166400001

Soft sensors that efficiently detect environmental or biological/physiological stimuli have been extensively studied due to their essential role in creating the necessary interfaces for these applications. Unfortunately, due to their natural softness, these sensors are highly sensitive to structural and mechanical damage. The integration of natural properties, such as self-healing, into these systems should improve their reliability, stability, and long-term performance. Recent studies on self-healing soft sensors for varying chemical and physical parameters are herein reviewed.

As an energy harvester to power wearable electronic devices, a flexible thermoelectric generator (f-TEG) can utilize human body heat as the energy source, creating an ideal solution. The fTEG can make conformal contact to the human skin and fully utilize body heat with minimal energy loss, while also being comfortable to wear. However, to maximize the power generated by an f-TEG attached to the human body, a careful thermal and structural design analysis of the f-TEG must be carried out. Here, we fabricated flexible thermoelectric generators (f-TEGs) with different device parameters and evaluated their power generating performance using an artificial arm, which was carefully designed to mimic a real human arm. We demonstrated the impact of the f-TEG device parameters on the power generation performance under various circumstances. The experimental results were compared with the theoretical model, and guidelines for an optimum device design in terms of maximizing the generated power density are also presented. Finally, we show that the optimum device structure varies when the efficiency of the power management IC (PMIC) is included in the analysis of the power generation system, which is practically important.									133	4	0	0	3	0	136			0306-2619	1872-9118											2018-12-28	WOS:000426411300011

Fusing traditional textiles with diagnostic, therapeutic, and protective medical devices can unlock electronic textiles (e-textiles) as point-of-care platform technologies on the human body, continuously monitoring vital signs and implementing round-the-clock treatment protocols in close proximity to the patient. This review comprehensively summarizes the research advances on e-textiles for wearable point-of-care systems.

However, the application of traditional hydrogels at extreme temperatures or for a long-term stability still remain a challenge because of the existence of water. Herein, we reported an antifreezing and antidrying organohydrogel with high transparency (over 85% transmittance), high stretchability (up to 1200%), and robust adhesiveness to various substrates, which consist of polyacrylic acid, gelatin, AlCl3+, and tannic acid in a water/glycerin binary solvent as the dispersion medium. As the binary solvent easily forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, organohydrogels exhibited excellent tolerance for drying and freezing. The organohydrogels maintained conductivity, adhesion, and stable sensitivity after a long-term storage or at subzero temperature (-14 degrees C). Moreover, the organohydrogel-based wearable sensors with a gauge factor of 2.5 (strain, 0-100%) could detect both large-scale movements and subtle motions. Therefore, the multifunctional organohydrogel-wearable sensors with antifreezing and antidrying properties have promising potential for human-machine interfaces and healthcare monitoring under a broad range of environmental conditions.									110	1	0	0	17	0	111			1944-8244	1944-8252											2021-01-04	WOS:000611066000143	33393770

Localized cooling by wearable thermoelectric coolers will decrease the usage of traditional systems, thereby reducing global warming and providing savings on energy costs. Since human skin as well as ambient air is a poor conductor of heat, wearable thermoelectric coolers operate under huge thermally resistive environment. The external thermal resistances greatly influence thermoelectric material behavior, device design, and device performance, which presents a fundamental challenge in achieving high efficiency for on-body applications. Here, we examine the combined effect of heat source/sink thermal resistances and thermoelectric material properties on thermoelectric cooler performance. Efficient thermoelectric coolers demonstrated here can cool the human skin up to 8.2 degrees C below the ambient temperature (170% higher cooling than commercial modules). Cost-benefit analysis shows that cooling over material volume for our optimized thermoelectric cooler is 500% higher than that of the commercial modules.									114	6	0	0	3	1	120			2041-1723												2019-05-01	WOS:000464654700004	30992438

Measurement of ionized calcium for clinical applications is not easily accessible due to its strict procedures and dependence on pH. pH balance in body fluids greatly affects metabolic reactions and biological transport systems. Here, we demonstrate a wearable electrochemical device for continuous monitoring of ionized calcium and pH of body fluids using a disposable and flexible array of Ca2+ and pH sensors that interfaces with a flexible printed circuit board. This platform enables real-time quantitative analysis of these sensing elements in body fluids such as sweat, urine, and tears. Accuracy of Ca2+ concentration and pH measured by the wearable sensors is validated through inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry technique and a commercial pH meter, respectively. Our results show that the wearable sensors have high repeatability and selectivity to the target ions.

For these applications lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries are vastly limited due to their relatively low power density and security risks. On the other hand, conventional supercapacitors are suitable for flexible and wearable electronics due to their high power density while their low energy density has hindered their wide applications. Lithium or sodium ion hybrid supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that benefit from the combined high energy density of batteries and high power density of supercapacitors. However, the use of organic electrolytes and shortage of lithium resources are expected to limit their widespread commercialization for flexible and wearable electronics. Here, for the first time, we introduce a safe and flexible solid-state zinc ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHS) based on co-polymer derived hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) as the cathode, polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel as the electrolyte and Zn deposited on carbon cloth as the anode. Owing to the high surface area of the HCSs and the hollow structure which improves the ion adsorption and desorption kinetics of the cathode, the flexible solid-state ZHS delivers a highest capacity of 86.8 mA h g(-1) and a maximum energy density of 59.7 W h kg(-1) with a power density of 447.8 W kg(-1). Besides, it displays excellent cycling stability with 98% capacity retention over 15000 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g(-1). Moreover, the solid-state ZHS is flexible enough to sustain various deformations including squeezing, twisting and folding due to the use of flexible electrodes and electrolytes. Our study unveils a pioneering flexible solid-state ZHS with high safety, which is a promising candidate for flexible and wearable energy storage devices.									186	11	0	0	6	0	186			2050-7488	2050-7496											2019-04-19	WOS:000463819400050

Current studies and optimizations of Zn anodes have not considered the special flexible working modes needed. In this study, we present the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curve areas of flexible anodes. The correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells is proposed. The interface contact of hydrogel electrolytes when working in a bending mode is another key factor affecting cell lifespan. After detailed analysis, the ideal cell configuration is shown to be hydrogel electrolytes with suitable chemistry, satisfactory mechanical properties, and high adhesivity. Thus a water in salt (WIS) hydrogel is proposed that demonstrates a highly stable cell performance. This work provides a new perspective in Zn anode research for the development of FESDs.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			1433-7851	1521-3773											2022-05-07	WOS:000787986100001	35347828

Herein, we demonstrate a novel Janus bacterial celluloses (BCs)/MXene film prepared by a facile vacuum filtration, which shows the potential as skin-contactable materials. The BCs act as a substrate and framework to effectively trap the permeated MXene nanosheets rather than simply mixing, which lead to formation of Janus structure. A thin (similar to 1.732 mu m), transparent, and light BCs/MXene film shows excellent tensile strength (up to similar to 532.87 MPa) and folding-endurance (similar to 6152 cycles). More importantly, the strong interaction between BCs and MXene is proved by theoretical computations and experimental tests. In addition, it exhibits a specific shielding effectiveness (SSE/t) of similar to 69455.2 dB cm(2) g(-1). These features make the composite film a promising candidate for wearable devices, military technology, and human electronic equipment.									99	5	0	0	21	0	100			1385-8947	1873-3212											2020-11-03	WOS:000579752500131

High power density is achieved via a unique combination of lithographically-patterned stretchable electronic framework together with screen-printed, densely-packed three-dimensional carbon-nanotube-based bioanode and cathode array arranged in a stretchable "island-bridge" configuration. The E-BFC maintains its performance even under repeated strains of 50%, and is stable for two days. When applied directly to the skin of human subjects, the E-BFC generates similar to 1 mW during exercise. The E-BFC is able to power conventional electronic devices, such as a light emitting diode and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. This is the first example of powering a BLE radio by a wearable biofuel cell. Successful generation of high power density under practical conditions and powering of conventional energy-intense electronic devices represents a major step forward in the field of soft, stretchable, wearable energy harvesting devices.									243	5	1	0	30	0	247			1754-5692	1754-5706											2017-07-01	WOS:000405279900006

Here we report the development and testing of a fully integrated wearable array of microneedles for the wireless and continuous real-time sensing of two metabolites (lactate and glucose, or alcohol and glucose) in the interstitial fluid of volunteers performing common daily activities. The device works with a custom smartphone app for data capture and visualization, comprises reusable electronics and a disposable microneedle array, and is optimized for system integration, cost-effective fabrication via advanced micromachining, easier assembly, biocompatibility, pain-free skin penetration and enhanced sensitivity. Single-analyte and dual-analyte measurements correlated well with the corresponding gold-standard measurements in blood or breath. Further validation of the technology in large populations with concurrent validation of sensor readouts through centralized laboratory tests should determine the robustness and utility of real-time simultaneous monitoring of several biomarkers in interstitial fluid.A wearable array of microneedle-based sensors can be used to wirelessly measure the levels of glucose simultaneously with those of alcohol or lactate in the interstitial fluid of volunteers performing common daily activities.									63	0	0	0	15	0	63			2157-846X												2022-05-18	WOS:000792563700001	35534575

However, the preparation of intelligent hydrogels that provide feedback on multiple electronic signals simultaneously, such as human skin receptors, when stimulated by external contact pressure remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we designed a bioinspired hydrogel with multiple conductive capabilities by incorporating carbon nanotubes into a chelate of calcium ions with polyacrylic acid and sodium alginate. The bioinspired hydrogel consolidates self-healing ability, stretchability, 3D printability, and multiple conductivities. It can be fabricated as an integrated strain sensor with simultaneous piezoresistive and piezocapacitive performances, exhibiting sensitive (gauge factor of 6.29 in resistance mode and 1.25 kPa(-1) in capacitance mode) responses to subtle pressure changes in the human body, such as finger flexion, knee flexion, and respiration. Furthermore, the bioinspired strain sensor sensitively and discriminatively recognizes the signatures written on it. Hence, we expect our ideas to provide inspiration for studies exploring the use of advanced hydrogels in multifunctional skin-like smart wearable devices.									77	4	0	0	10	0	78			1944-8244	1944-8252											2021-01-07	WOS:000612551400076	33411490

This success can be attributed to the rich luminescent properties of organic materials, but efficiency enhancement made over the last few decades has also played a significant role in making OLEDs a practically viable technology. This report summarizes the efforts made so far to improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OLEDs and discusses what should further be done to push toward the ultimate efficiency that can be offered by OLEDs. The study indicates that EQE close to 58% and 80% can be within reach without and with additional light extraction structures, respectively, with an optimal combination of cavity engineering, low-index transport layers, and horizontal dipole orientation. In addition, recent endeavors to identify possible applications of OLEDs beyond displays are presented with emphasis on their potential in wearable healthcare, such as OLED-based pulse oximetry as well as phototherapeutic applications based on body-attachable flexible OLED patches.

Over the past few decades, several studies have been conducted with conventional fNIRS systems that have demonstrated the suitability of this technology for a wide variety of populations and applications, to investigate both the healthy brain and the diseased brain. However, what makes wearable fNIRS even more appealing is its capability to allow measurements in everyday-life scenarios that are not possible with other gold-standard neuroimaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. This could have a huge impact on the way we explore the neural bases and mechanisms underpinning human brain functioning. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of studies conducted with wearable fNIRS in naturalistic settings in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In addition, we present the challenges associated with the use of wearable fNIRS in unrestrained contexts, discussing solutions that will allow accurate inference of functional brain activity.

In the order of historical development, sensing platforms are classified into four types: electronic skins for robotics and medical applications, wearable devices for in vitro diagnostics, implantable devices for human organs or tissues for surgical applications, and advanced sensing devices with additional features such as transparency, self-power, and self-healing. In all of these examples, a polymer layer is used as a versatile component including a flexible structural support and a functional material to generate, transmit, and process mechanical and electrical inputs in various ways. We briefly discuss some outlooks and future challenges toward the next steps for flexible devices. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

The bottleneck in this field is how to develop devices of high energy and power density, by using economically viable materials and scalable fabrication technologies. Here we report a hierarchical graphene-metallic textile composite electrode concept to address this challenge. The hierarchical composite electrodes consist of low-cost graphene sheets immobilized on the surface of Ni-coated cotton yarns, which are fabricated by highly scalable electroless deposition of Ni and electrochemical deposition of graphene on commercial cotton yarns. Remarkably, the volumetric energy density and power density of the all solid-state supercapacitor yarn made of one pair of these composite electrodes are 6.1 mWhcm(-3) and 1,400 mWcm(-3), respectively. In addition, this SC yarn is lightweight, highly flexible, strong, durable in life cycle and bending fatigue tests, and integratable into various wearable electronic devices.									543	22	0	0	32	0	550			2041-1723												2015-06-01	WOS:000357170100001	26068809

These continuously evolving technology platforms do not only promise to help people pursue a healthier life style, but also provide continuous medical data for actively tracking metabolic status, diagnosis, and treatment. Advances in the miniaturization of flexible electronics, electrochemical biosensors, microfluidics, and artificial intelligence algorithms have led to wearable devices that can generate real-time medical data within the Internet of things. These flexible devices can be configured to make conformal contact with epidermal, ocular, intracochlear, and dental interfaces to collect biochemical or electrophysiological signals. This article discusses consumer trends in wearable electronics, commercial and emerging devices, and fabrication methods. It also reviews real-time monitoring of vital signs using biosensors, stimuli-responsive materials for drug delivery, and closed-loop theranostic systems. It covers future challenges in augmented, virtual, and mixed reality, communication modes, energy management, displays, conformity, and data safety.

Currently, glucose in the body is measured by an invasive method of blood sugar testing. Blood glucose (BG) monitoring devices measure the amount of sugar in a small sample of blood, usually drawn from pricking the fingertip, and placed on a disposable test strip. Therefore, there is a need for non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring, which is possible using a sweat sensor-based approach. As sweat sensors have garnered much interest in recent years, this study attempts to summarize recent developments in non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring using sweat sensors based on different approaches with an emphasis on the devices that can potentially be integrated into a wearable platform. Numerous research entities have been developing wearable sensors for continuous blood glucose monitoring, however, there are no commercially viable, non-invasive glucose monitors on the market at the moment. This review article provides the state-of-the-art in sweat glucose monitoring, particularly keeping in sight the prospect of its commercialization. The challenges relating to sweat collection, sweat sample degradation, person to person sweat amount variation, various detection methods, and their glucose detection sensitivity, and also the commercial viability are thoroughly covered.									25	0	0	0	4	0	25				1424-8220											2022-02-06	WOS:000747700500001	35062598

Advances in soft materials have led to skin-like sensors and muscle-like actuators for soft robots and wearable devices(1-3). Flexible or stretchable counterparts of most key mechatronic components have been developed(4,5), principally using fluidically driven systems(6-8); other reported mechanisms include electrostatic(9-12), stimuli-responsive gels(13,14) and thermally responsive materials such as liquid metals(15-17) and shape-memory polymers(18). Despite the widespread use of fluidic actuation, there have been few soft counterparts of pumps or compressors, limiting the portability and autonomy of soft machines(4,8). Here we describe a class of soft-matter bidirectional pumps based on charge-injection electrohydrodynamics(19). These solid-state pumps are flexible, stretchable, modular, scalable, quiet and rapid. By integrating the pump into a glove, we demonstrate wearable active thermal management. Embedding the pump in an inflatable structure produces a self-contained fluidic 'muscle'. The stretchable pumps have potential uses in wearable laboratory-on-a-chip and microfluidic sensors, thermally active clothing and autonomous soft robots.									187	9	1	0	16	0	192			0028-0836	1476-4687											2019-08-22	WOS:000482219600043	31413364

However, only limited attention has been directed at developing wearable chemical sensors that offer more comprehensive information about a wearer's well-being. The development of wearable chemical sensors faces multiple challenges on various fronts. This perspective reviews key challenges and technological gaps impeding the successful realization of effective wearable chemical sensor systems, related to materials, power, analytical procedure, communication, data acquisition, processing, and security. Size, rigidity, and operational requirements of present chemical sensors are incompatible with wearable technology. Sensor stability and on-body sensor surface regeneration constitute key analytical challenges. Similarly, present wearable power sources are incapable of meeting the requirements for wearable electronics owing to their low energy densities and slow recharging. Several energy-harvesting methodologies have inherent issues, including inconsistent power supply and limited stability. There are also major challenges pertaining to handling and securing the big data generated by wearable sensors. These include achieving high data transfer rates and efficient data mining. Efforts must also be made toward developing next generation cryptologic algorithms for ensuring data security and user privacy. The challenges facing the field of wearable chemical sensors, and wearable sensors, in general, can thus be addressed only by a multidisciplinary approach where researchers from diverse fields work in unison. The article discusses these challenges and their potential solutions along with future prospects.									483	13	0	0	86	1	515			2379-3694												2016-05-01	WOS:000385464600002

However, fabricating transparent, ultrastretchable, and biocompatible hydrogel with low-temperature stability still remains a tremendous challenge. In this study, an ultrastretchable, highly transparent, and antifreezing zwitterionic-based electronic sensor is developed by introducing zwitterionic proline (ZP) into gellan gum/polyacrylamide (GG/PAAm) double network (DN) hydrogel. The existence of ZP endows the hydrogel with remarkable frost resistance. The toughness and transparency of zwitterionic Ca-GG/PAAm-ZP DN hydrogel can be maintained down to -40 degrees C. Also, the zwitterionic hydrogel shows good biocompatibility and protein adsorption resistance. The zwitterionic Ca-GG/PAAm-ZP DN hydrogel-based strain sensor can accurately monitor human motions (such as speaking and various joint bendings) under a broad temperature range from -40 to 25 degrees C. The zwitterionic Ca-GG/PAAm-ZP DN hydrogel-based strain sensor will be of immense value in the field of wearable electronic devices, especially for extreme environment applications.									53	1	0	0	8	0	54			1525-7797	1526-4602											2021-04-16	WOS:000627592800017	33586969

A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on textiles can be an optimal option for scavenging low-frequency and irregular waste energy from body motions as a power source for self-sustainable systems. However, the low output of most textile-based TENGs (T-TENGs) has hindered its way toward practical applications. In this work, a facile and universal strategy to enhance the triboelectric output is proposed by integration of a narrow-gap TENG textile with a high-voltage diode and a textile-based switch. The closed-loop current of the diode-enhanced textile-based TENG (D-T-TENG) can be increased by 25 times. The soft, flexible, and thin characteristics of the D-T-TENG enable a moderate output even as it is randomly scrunched. Furthermore, the enhanced current can directly stimulate rat muscle and nerve. In addition, the capability of the D-T-TENG as a practical power source for wearable sensors is demonstrated by powering Bluetooth sensors embedded to clothes for humidity and temperature sensing. Looking forward, the D-T-TENG renders an effective approach toward a self-sustainable wearable textile nano-energy nano-system for next-generation healthcare applications.									125	5	0	0	8	0	127				2198-3844											2019-10-24	WOS:000492158500001	31871857

Therefore, the sensor should have a flexible structure and wide pressure measurement range along with high sensitivity. In this study, we fabricated hierarchically porous structured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites with a simple and cost-effective method using sugar particles and a water-in-oil emulsion. Hierarchically porous PDMS composites were employed as the dielectric layers of flexible capacitive pressure sensors. The capacitive pressure sensor presents a sensitivity 22.5 times higher (0.18 kPa(-1)) than the sensors using bulk PDMS with a wide measurement range (0-400 kPa). The finite element analysis was implemented to analyze the non-linearity of sensors by observing the compressive behavior of the PDMS composites. For the practical applications, finger attached-sensor, respiration monitoring system, and sensor array were tested, and the proposed sensors showed sufficient potential for application in wearable electronics.									100	4	0	0	1	0	102			1359-8368	1879-1069											2021-04-17	WOS:000632882800002

For flexible perovskite solar cells, achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) while using a low-temperature technology for the fabrication of a compact charge collection layer is a critical issue. Herein, we report on a flexible perovskite solar cell exhibiting 12.2% PCE as a result of the employment of an annealing-free, 20 nm thick, amorphous, compact TiOx layer deposited by atomic layer deposition. The excellent performance of the cell was attributed to fast electron transport, verified by time-resolved photoluminescence and impedance studies. The PCE remained the same down to 0.4 sun illumination, as well as to a 45 degrees tilt to incident light. Mechanical bending of the devices worsened device performance by only 7% when a bending radius of 1 mm was used. The devices maintained 95% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles for a bending radius of 10 mm. Degradation of the device performance by the bending was the result of crack formation from the transparent conducting oxide layer, demonstrating the potential of the low-temperature-processed TiOx layer to achieve more efficient and bendable perovskite solar cells, which becomes closer to a practical wearable power source.									530	27	0	0	19	0	542			1754-5692	1754-5706											2015-01-01	WOS:000352274600017

Conventional medical testing methods require specialized laboratory equipment and well-trained operators, limiting the applicability of these tests. Microfluidic point-of-care (POC) equipment can rapidly detect diseases at low cost. This technology could be used to detect diseases in underdeveloped areas to reduce the effects of disease and improve quality of life in these areas. This review details microfluidic POC equipment and its applications. First, the concept of microfluidic POC devices is discussed. We then describe applications of microfluidic POC devices for infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tumors (cancer), and chronic diseases, and discuss the future incorporation of microfluidic POC devices into applications such as wearable devices and telemedicine. Finally, the review concludes by analyzing the present state of the microfluidic field, and suggestions are made. This review is intended to call attention to the status of disease treatment in underdeveloped areas and to encourage the researchers of microfluidics to develop standards for these devices.									29	0	0	0	9	0	29				1424-8220											2022-04-02	WOS:000771464200001	35214519

Yet, little is known about why some people are more likely to adopt smartwatches than others. To deepen the understanding of underlying factors prompting adoption behavior, the authors develop a theoretical model grounded in technology acceptance and social psychology literatures. Empirical results reveal perceived usefulness and visibility as important factors that drive adoption intention, suggesting that smartwatches represent a type of 'fashnology' (i.e., fashion and technology). The magnitude of these antecedents is influenced by an individual's perception of viewing smartwatches as a technology and/or as a fashion accessory.

To that end, developing flexible and wearable energy storage devices is a must. Recently, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) and zinc-ion capacitors (ZICs) stand out as two of the most potent candidates for wearable electronics due to their excellent electrochemical performance, intrinsic safety, low cost, and functional controllability. Simultaneously, polymer electrolytes' introduction and rational design, especially various hydrogels, have endowed conventional ZIBs and ZICs with colorful functions, which has been regarded as a perfect answer for energy suppliers integrated into those advanced wearable electronic devices. This review focuses on the functional hydrogel electrolytes (HEs) and their application for ZIBs and ZICs. Previously reported HEs for ZIBs and ZICs were classified and analyzed, from the flexibility to mechanical endurance, temperature adaptability, electrochemical stability, and finally cell-level ZIBs and ZICs based on multifunctional HEs. Besides introducing the diverse and exciting functions of HEs, working principles were also analyzed. Ultimately, all the details of these examples were summarized, and the related challenges, constructive solutions, and futural prospects of functional ZIBs and ZICs were also dedicatedly evaluated.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12				2575-0356											2023-02-26	WOS:000931009600001

An example of simultaneous noninvasive sampling and analysis of two different biofluids using a single wearable epidermal platform is demonstrated here. The concept is successfully realized through sweat stimulation (via transdermal pilocarpine delivery) at an anode, alongside extraction of interstitial fluid (ISF) at a cathode. The system thus allows on-demand, controlled sampling of the two epidermal biofluids at the same time, at two physically separate locations (on the same flexible platform) containing different electrochemical biosensors for monitoring the corresponding biomarkers. Such a dual biofluid sampling and analysis concept is implemented using a cost-effective screen-printing technique with body-compliant temporary tattoo materials and conformal wireless readout circuits to enable real-time measurement of biomarkers in the sampled epidermal biofluids. The performance of the developed wearable device is demonstrated by measuring sweat-alcohol and ISF-glucose in human subjects consuming food and alcoholic drinks. The different compositions of sweat and ISF with good correlations of their chemical constituents to their blood levels make the developed platform extremely attractive for enhancing the power and scope of next-generation noninvasive epidermal biosensing systems.									269	7	0	0	59	0	272			2198-3844												2018-12-28	WOS:000447632000018	30356971

For realization, with the achievement of simple synaptic behaviors in a single device, the construction of artificial synapses with various functions of sensing and responding and integrated systems to mimic complicated computing, sensing, and responding in biological systems is a prerequisite. Artificial synapses that have learning ability can perceive and react to events in the real world; these abilities expand the neuromorphic applications toward health monitoring and cybernetic devices in the future Internet of Things. To demonstrate the flexible neuromorphic systems successfully, it is essential to develop artificial synapses and nerves replicating the functionalities of the biological counterparts and satisfying the requirements for constructing the elements and the integrated systems such as flexibility, low power consumption, high-density integration, and biocompatibility. Here, the progress of flexible neuromorphic electronics is addressed, from basic backgrounds including synaptic characteristics, device structures, and mechanisms of artificial synapses and nerves, to applications for computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics.

However, sweat-based glucose sensing still faces many challenges, such as difficulty in sweat collection, activity variation of glucose oxidase due to lactic acid secretion and ambient temperature changes, and delamination of the enzyme when exposed to mechanical friction and skin deformation. Precise point-of-care therapy in response to the measured glucose levels is still very challenging. We present a wearable/disposable sweat-based glucose monitoring device integrated with a feedback transdermal drug delivery module. Careful multilayer patch design and miniaturization of sensors increase the efficiency of the sweat collection and sensing process. Multimodal glucose sensing, as well as its real-time correction based on pH, temperature, and humidity measurements, maximizes the accuracy of the sensing. The minimal layout design of the same sensors also enables a strip-type disposable device. Drugs for the feedback transdermal therapy are loaded on two different temperature-responsive phase change nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are embedded in hyaluronic acid hydrogel microneedles, which are additionally coated with phase change materials. This enables multistage, spatially patterned, and precisely controlled drug release in response to the patient's glucose level. The system provides a novel closed-loop solution for the noninvasive sweat-based management of diabetes mellitus.									671	29	0	0	163	0	681			2375-2548												2017-03-01	WOS:000397044000018	28345030

Despite significant progress in the fabrication of flexible biosensors that naturally comply with the epidermis, most designs measure only a small number of physical or electrophysiological parameters, and neglect the rich chemical information available from biomarkers. Here, we introduce a skin-worn wearable hybrid sensing system that offers simultaneous real-time monitoring of a biochemical (lactate) and an electrophysiological signal (electrocardiogram), for more comprehensive fitness monitoring than from physical or electrophysiological sensors alone. The two sensing modalities, comprising a three-electrode amperometric lactate biosensor and a bipolar electrocardiogram sensor, are co-fabricated on a flexible substrate and mounted on the skin. Human experiments reveal that physiochemistry and electrophysiology can be measured simultaneously with negligible cross-talk, enabling a new class of hybrid sensing devices.									547	18	0	0	96	0	586			2041-1723												2016-05-01	WOS:000376204100001	27212140

Herein, we demonstrate the rational design and preparation of hollow and ultrathin nickel cobalt sulfides nanosheets arrays on electrochemical activated carbon cloth (Ni-Co-S/ACC) for fabrication of flexible hybrid supercapacitors, where the Ni-Co-S nanosheets are derived from the metal-organic framework via an etching/ion exchange method. The Ni-Co-S/ACC electrode can deliver a very high specific capacitance of 2392 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and good rate performance (80.3% capacitance retention at 20 A/g). The enhanced electrochemical properties should be attributed to the hydrophilic property, good conductivity and enriched redox active sites resulted from the electrochemical activated carbon cloth and the hollow and ultrathin structure of Ni-Co-S nanosheets. When a flexible hybrid supercapacitor is assembled using Ni-Co-S/ACC as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode, it shows high energy density of 30.1 Wh/Kg at power density of 800.2 W/Kg as well as predominant cycling stability (82% retention after 10,000 cycles).

However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (<1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze-thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.									55	0	0	0	5	0	55			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-07-15	WOS:000822950600001	35726439

Based on the microstructure packaging strategy, PCMs are developed into shape-stabilized PCMs, which can solve the problem of leakage when phase change occurs. However, shape-stabilized PCMs usually have the disadvantage of poor mechanical properties, and the thermal resistance increases due to the poor fit with heat transfer elements. With the development of flexible electronic devices and wearable devices, flexible phase change materials (FPCMs) with excellent mechanical properties have become a hot spot. This paper introduces the preparation methods of FPCMs from both internal molecular support and external skeleton support. In addition, the flexibility mechanism and the properties of FPCM are summarized and analyzed.

Here, we describe a flexible epidermal microfluidic detection platform fabricated through hybridization of lithographic and screen-printed technologies, for efficient and fast sweat sampling and continuous, real-time electrochemical monitoring of glucose and lactate levels. This soft, skin-mounted device judiciously merges lab-on-a-chip and electrochemical detection technologies, integrated with a miniaturized flexible electronic board for real-time wireless data transmission to a mobile device. Modeling of the device design and sweat flow conditions allowed optimization of the sampling process and the microchannel layout for achieving attractive fluid dynamics and rapid filling of the detection reservoir (within 8 min from starting exercise). The wearable microdevice thus enabled efficient natural sweat pumping to the electrochemical detection chamber containing the enzyme-modified electrode transducers. The fabricated device can be easily mounted on the epidermis without hindrance to the wearer and displays resiliency against continuous mechanical deformation expected from such epidermal wear. Amperometric biosensing of lactate and glucose from the rapidly generated sweat, using the corresponding immobilized oxidase enzymes, was wirelessly monitored during cycling activity of different healthy subjects. This ability to monitor sweat glucose levels introduces new possibilities for effective diabetes management, while similar lactate monitoring paves the way for new wearable fitness applications. The new epidermal microfluidic electrochemical detection strategy represents an attractive alternative to recently reported colorimetric sweat-monitoring methods, and hence holds considerable promise for practical fitness or health monitoring applications.									240	8	0	0	59	0	246			2379-3694												2017-12-01	WOS:000418879500016	29152973

However, to obtain a complete picture of human health, it is necessary but challenging to track multiple analytes inside the body simultaneously. Here, we present a wearable plasmonic-electronic sensor with "universal" molecular recognition ability. Flexible plasmonic metasurface with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-activity is introduced as the fundamental sensing component in a wearable sensor since we solved the technical challenge of maintaining the plasmonic activities of their brittle nanostructures under various deformations. Together with a flexible electronic sweat extraction system, our sensor can noninvasively extract and "fingerprint" analytes inside the body based on their unique SERS spectra. As a proof-of-concept example, we successfully monitored the variation of trace-amounts drugs inside the body and obtained an individual's drug metabolic profile. Our sensor bridges the existing gap in wearable sensing technology by providing a universal, sensitive molecular tracking means to assess human health.									101	4	0	0	11	0	102			2375-2548												2021-02-17	WOS:000610099000038	33523953

Methods An effective deep learning-based technology is proposed to automatically detect atrial fibrillation. First, novel preprocessing algorithms, wavelet transform and sliding window filtering, are introduced to reduce the noise and outliers, respectively, from ECG signals. Then, a robust R-wave detection algorithm is developed. In addition, we proposed a feedforward neural network to detect atrial fibrillation based on ECG records. Results Experiments verified using a tenfold cross-validation strategy showed that the proposed method achieves competitive detection performance, and can be applied to wearable detection devices. The proposed R-wave detection algorithm achieved a detection sensitivity of 99.22%, a positive recognition rate of 98.55%, and a deviance of 2.25% on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed atrial fibrillation detection model achieved an accuracy of 84.00%, a detection sensitivity of 84.26%, a specificity of 93.23%, and an area under the receiver operating curve of 89.40% on a mixed dataset composed of the Challenge2017 database and the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

Flexible solid-state supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted increasing interest because they can provide substantially higher specific/volumetric energy density compared to conventional capacitors. Additionally, flexible solid-state SCs are typically small in size, highly reliable, light-weight, easy to handle, and have a wide range of operation temperatures. In this regard, solid-state SCs hold great promise as new energy storage devices for flexible and wearable electronics. In this article, we review recent achievements in the design, fabrication and characterization of flexible solid-state SCs. Moreover, we also discuss the current challenges and future opportunities for the development of high-performance flexible solid-state SCs.									1047	68	0	0	68	0	1070			1754-5692	1754-5706											2014-07-01	WOS:000337977600006

To fulfill the requirements for different applications, new material design and device fabrication strategies have been developed in order to manipulate the mechanical and electrical properties and enhance device performance. In this paper, the important progresses in flexible pressure sensor development over recent years are selectively reviewed from a material and application perspective. First, an overview of the fundamental working mechanism and the systematic design approach is presented. Particularly, how the theoretical modeling has been used as an auxiliary tool to achieve better sensing performance is discussed. A number of applications, including human-machine interfaces, electronic skin and health monitoring, and certain application-driven functions, e.g., pressure distribution visualization and direction-sensitive force detection, are highlighted.

However, in an effort to maintain its highly conductive and long-term stability of cotton fabrics under harsh condition, it is an imperative demand to prepare superhydrophobic MXenes-textile sensor. Herein, a waterproof, highly sensitive, and wearable multi mode sensor was successfully fabricated by the construction of 2D MXene nanosheets and zero-dimension (0D) silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) onto a cotton fibers substrate (MX@SiNPs cotton). The as-cultivated MX@SiNPs cotton exhibited an integration of high-performance sensing toward pression, bending, and torsion, superior sensitivity (S-1 = 12.23 kPa(-1)), a stable response under press-relaxing cycles, and broad sensing ranges (pressure: 8.8 Pa - 70 kPa, bending: 0 - 180 degrees, torsion: 0 - 628 rad m(-1)). By virtue of its hierarchical structure and low surface energy of the SiNPs layer, the MXenes-textile sensor can maintain intrinsic conductivity under wet and corrosive conditions. The waterproof and highly sensitive MXene-reinforced cotton fabrics lay a basis for the broad-range application and large-scale preparation of the sensor and prolong its service life.									53	4	0	0	5	0	54			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-03-02	WOS:000613340700001

Components and interconnections are intrinsic to the fabric and thus are less visible and not susceptible of becoming tangled or snagged by surrounding objects. E-textiles can also more easily adapt to fast changes in the computational and sensing requirements of any specific application, this one representing a useful feature for power management and context awareness. The vision behind wearable computing foresees future electronic systems to be an integral part of our everyday outfits. Such electronic devices have to meet special requirements concerning wearability. Wearable systems will be characterized by their ability to automatically recognize the activity and the behavioral status of their own user as well as of the situation around her/him, and to use this information to adjust the systems' configuration and functionality. This review focuses on recent advances in the field of Smart Textiles and pays particular attention to the materials and their manufacturing process. Each technique shows advantages and disadvantages and our aim is to highlight a possible trade-off between flexibility, ergonomics, low power consumption, integration and eventually autonomy.									1309	33	1	3	68	1	1392			1424-8220												2014-07-01	WOS:000340035700038	25004153

Meanwhile, luminescence is an important functionality to wearables for illumination, energy saving, identification and manipulation in the dark, and safety during nocturnal activities. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are promising power suppliers and self-powered sensors. However, the instant TENG electricity can only produce transient luminescence, and the energy required for luminescence consumes the energy reserved for other electronics. Inspired by bioluminescent Mycena chlorophos, a self-luminescing and energy-harvesting triboelectric fiber (SLEH-TF) is proposed as a wearable energy provider, self-powered sensor, and human-device interface. It comprises a conducting thread clad in an elastic phosphorescent triboelectric composite and can be knitted into a large-area highly stretchable (> 100% strain) textile for sustainably powering gadgets. It can convert biomechanical energy into available electricity (Voc = 15 V and Isc = 500 nA from a 5-cm SLEH-TF; Voc = 250 V and Isc = 80 mu A from a palm-sized SLEH-TF textile) and simultaneously emit long-lasting visible light (50 mcd m(-2) for > 120 min) after a short exposure to daylight (5 min). Furthermore, SLEH-TF can be used for detecting pressure (with sensitivity of 11.48 V N-1 and 119.54 nA N-1 (< 1 N)), touch, and gestures via self-generating electricity. Finally, system-level smart clothes using the newly-designed fibers are presented. The seamless integration of luminescence into energy harvesting fabrics can advance the development of autonomous wearable accessories.									28	3	0	0	0	0	28			2211-2855	2211-3282											2022-04-27	WOS:000782175100003

Here, the first single waterproof and fabric-based multifunctional triboelectric nanogenerator (WPF-MTENG) is presented, which can produce electricity from both natural tiny impacts (rain and wind) and body movements, and can not only serve as a flexible, adaptive, wearable, and universal energy collector but also act as a self-powered, active, fabric-based sensor. The working principle comes from a conjunction of contact triboelectrification and electrostatic induction during contact/separation of internal soft fabrics. The structural/material designs of the WPF-MTENG are systematically studied to optimize its performance, and its outputs under different conditions of rain, wind, and various body movements are comprehensively investigated. Its applicability is practically demonstrated in various objects and working situations to gather ambient energy. Lastly, a WPF-MTENG-based keypad as self-powered human-system interfaces is demonstrated on a garment for remotely controlling a music-player system. This multifunctional WPF-MTENG, which is as flexible as clothes, not only presents a promising step toward democratic collections of alternative energy but also provides a new vision for wearable technologies.									195	8	0	0	5	0	197			2198-3844												2019-03-19	WOS:000460374300004	30886807

However, the fabrication of wearable TENGs still remains great challenges, such as flexibility, breathability and washability. Here, a route to develop a new kind of woven-structured triboelectric nanogenerator (WS-TENG) with a facile, low-cost, and scalable electrospinning technique is reported. The WS-TENG is fabricated with commercial stainless-steel yarns wrapped by electrospun polyamide 66 nanofiber and poly(vinylidenefluorideco-trifluoroethylene) nanofiber, respectively. Triggered by diversified friction materials under a working principle of freestanding mode, the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and maximum instantaneous power density from the WS-TENG can reach up to 166 V, 8.5 mu A and 93 mW/m(2), respectively. By virtue of high flexibility, desirable breathability, washability and excellent durability, the fabricated WS-TENG is demonstrated to be a reliable power textile to light up 58 light-emitting diodes (LED) connected serially, charge commercial capacitors and drive portable electronics. A smart glove with stitched WS-TENGs is made to detect finger motion in different circumstances. The work presents a new approach for self-powered textiles with potential applications in biomechanical energy harvesting, wearable electronics and human motion monitoring.									99	2	0	0	1	0	101			2211-2855	2211-3282											2021-03-08	WOS:000618009300002

Power sources with these characteristics are difficult and challenging to achieve. The use of liquid metals as electrodes may provide a viable strategy to produce such power sources. In this work, we propose a liquid metal-based triboelectric nanogenerator (LM-TENG) by employing Galinstan as the electrode and silicone rubber as the triboelectric and encapsulation layer. The small Young's modulus of the liquid metal ensures the electrode remains continuously conductive under deformations, stretching to a strain as large as similar to 300%. The surface oxide layer of Galinstan effectively prevents the liquid Galinstan electrode from further oxidization and permeation into silicone rubber, yielding outstanding device stability. Operating in the single-electrode mode at 3 Hz, the LM-TENG with an area of 6 x 3 cm(2) produces an open-circuit voltage of 354.5 V, transferred short-circuit charge of 123.2 nC, short-circuit current of 15.6 mu A, and average power density of 8.43 mW/m(2), which represent outstanding performance values for TENGs. Further, the LM-TENG maintains stable performance under various deformations, such as stretching, folding, and twisting. LM-TENGs in different forms, such as bulk-shaped, bracelet-like, and textile-like, are all able to harvest mechanical energy from human walking, arm shaking, or hand patting to sustainably drive wearable electronic devices.									294	16	0	0	11	0	300			1936-0851	1936-086X											2018-02-01	WOS:000426615600116	29420011

Continuous glucose monitoring addresses the limitations of finger-stick blood testing and provides the opportunity for optimal therapeutic interventions. This article reviews recent advances and challenges toward the development of non-invasive epidermal electrochemical glucose sensing systems. Recent reports claim success in glucose monitoring in human subjects using skin-worn electrochemical sensors. Such epidermal electrochemical biosensors obviate the disadvantages of minimally-invasive subcutaneous glucose biosensors and offer promise for improved glycemic control. The ability of such systems to monitor glucose non-invasively offers an attractive route toward advancing the management of diabetes and achieving improved glycemic control.

However, profound challenges remain in terms of imitating human skin because of its unique combination of mechanical and sensory properties. In this work, a bioinspired mineral hydrogel is developed to fabricate a novel type of mechanically adaptable ionic skin sensor. Due to its unique viscoelastic properties, the hydrogel-based capacitive sensor is compliant, self-healable, and can sense subtle pressure changes, such as a gentle finger touch, human motion, or even small water droplets. It might not only show great potential in applications such as artificial intelligence, human/machine interactions, personal healthcare, and wearable devices, but also promote the development of next-generation mechanically adaptable intelligent skin-like devices.									705	53	0	0	84	0	730			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-06-13	WOS:000402963400010	28417600

The establishment of a sustainable wireless internet of thing (IoT) sensory system is urged by developing the energy harvesters and self-powered sensors based on specific scenarios. As one of the dominant energy sources from the human body, mechanical energy offers a great opportunity for piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to accomplish the tasks. Both two techniques are featured with simple conversion mechanisms and easy integration for wearable and implantable devices. In this review, starting from the fundamental principle, both wearable and implantable PENG and TENG are thoroughly discussed, with different mechanical stimuli, including force, strain, vibration, etc., and various materials, such as ceramic, polymer, textile/nanowires, etc. Furthermore, based on the outputs from PENG and TENG, the self-powered physical sensors are investigated to exploit the potential of motion recognition or physiological signals monitoring. Besides, the introduction of hybrid systems also provides an overview of the joint function of PENG and TENG for enhancing both power generation and sensing performances. For achieving the IoT sensory network, the representative researches on wireless transmission of both energy and sensing signals are investigated according to the different transmission ranges. In general, this review offers comprehensive knowledge about the recent advances and the future outlook regarding the sustainable wireless sensory system specifically for the human body.

In contrast to other types of energy harvester, they can harvest sufficient electricity (on the order of milliwatts) for wearable devices by utilizing the cloth itself as the platform for photovoltaics. Three features are important for textile-compatible photovoltaics, namely environmental stability, sufficient energy efficiency and mechanical robustness. However, achieving these simultaneously remains difficult because of the low gas barrier properties of ultrathin superstrates and substrates. Here, we report on ultraflexible organic photovoltaics coated on both sides with elastomer that simultaneously realize stretchability and stability in water whilst maintaining a high efficiency of 7.9%. The efficiency of double-side-coated devices decreases only by 5.4% after immersion in water for 120 min. Furthermore, the efficiency of the devices remains at 80% of the initial value even after 52% mechanical compression for 20 cycles with 100 min of water exposure.									303	6	0	0	14	0	305			2058-7546												2017-10-01	WOS:000415191200012

It's attracting more and more attentions with the development of flexible/wearable devices thanks to the great flexibility and ductility of PPy as a polymer. This review presents a comprehensive understanding on synthesis, morphology control, electrochemical performances and solid-state devices of the nanostructured PPy and its nanocomposites. In the past decades, a variety of nanostructures, including one-, two-, and three-dimensional, have been designed and fabricated via different methods, demonstrating a great potential for the application as supercapacitor electrodes. Thereafter, many nanostructured PPy-based supercapacitors with different macroscopic configurations have been presented aiming to achieve better electrochemical performance, and some representative ones, for example, flexible and/or wearable supercapacitors, are summarized in this review. Cycling stability is another critical issue that determines its practicability of the PPy-based devices. Solutions to improve cycling performance and mechanisms behind are also discussed. Last, perspectives for the future development in nanostructured PPy-based supercapacitors are described.

However, the currently existing energy storage materials normally suffer from several drawbacks, such as poor flexibility, hidden danger, toxicity and especially low energy density, limiting their practical applications. Expanding the voltage window by employing the hydrogel electrolyte is regarded as an effective method to improve the energy density of supercapacitor. Herein, we employ a zwitterionic natural polymer hydrogel with excellent mechanical strength and flexibility as electrolyte to assemble a solid-state zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (H-ZHS) with Zn foil and activated carbon electrode. The H-ZHS exhibits an amazingly wide and stable voltage window of 2.4 V, high maximum energy density of 286.6 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 220 W kg(-1) and superior capacity retention of 95.4% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g(-1) calculated based on mass of activated carbon electrode. The strategy in this work should provide a new insight in exploring zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor with high energy density for flexible wearable electronic devices.									161	4	0	0	8	0	163			1385-8947	1873-3212											2020-04-30	WOS:000525862500091

Recent insights into novel fabrication methodologies and electrochemical techniques have resulted in the demonstration of chemical sensors able to augment conventional physical measurements (i.e. heart rate, EEG, ECG, etc.), thereby providing added dimensions of rich, analytical information to the wearer in a timely manner. Wearable electrochemical sensors have been integrated onto both textile materials and directly on the epidermis for various monitoring applications owing to their unique ability to process chemical analytes in a non-invasive and non-obtrusive fashion. In this manner, multi-analyte detection can easily be performed, in real time, in order to ascertain the overall physiological health of the wearer or to identify potential offenders in their environment. Of profound importance is the development of an understanding of the impact of mechanical strain on textile- and epidermal (tattoo)-based sensors and their failure mechanisms as well as the compatibility of the substrate employed in the fabrication process. We conclude this review with a retrospective outlook of the field and identify potential implications of this new sensing paradigm in the healthcare, fitness, security, and environmental monitoring domains. With continued innovation and detailed attention to core challenges, it is expected that wearable electrochemical sensors will play a pivotal role in the emergent body sensor networks arena.					14th International Conference on Electroanalysis (ESEAC)14th International Conference on Electroanalysis (ESEAC)	JUN 03-07, 2012JUN 03-07, 2012		Portoroz, SLOVENIAPortoroz, SLOVENIA	474	14	1	0	116	2	522			1040-0397	1521-4109											2013-01-01	WOS:000313807600005

Metal sulfide electrodes, which can meet the need of new energy materials, are one of the most representative candidates in energy devices. Here, a universal method is developed to in-situ grow a series of battery-type metal sulfide core-shell nanoneedle films (i.e., Co9S8-MoS2, Co9S8-NiS2, Co9S8-NiCo2S4, NiCo2S4-CuS, NiCo2S4-NiS2, and NiCo2S4-MoS2) on carbon cloth. When served as active materials in electrochemical tests, the Co9S8-NiCo2S4 electrode shows superior energy storage ability with a specific capacity of 337.78 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and a retention rate of 93% undergoing 5000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). Subsequently, the Co9S8-NiCo2S4 electrode is assembled into a flexible all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor, which delivers a maximum specific energy of 56.44 W h kg(-1) at 795 W kg(-1) and a maximum specific power of 8153 W kg(-1) at 29.44 W h kg(-1). Finally, such hybrid metal sulfide-based device can be made into wearable chargers to drive a low-power electronic device. This study provides a facile strategy to rationally prepare a variety of heterostructured metal sulfide films and then effectively select high-performance electrodes for energy storage devices.									122	5	0	0	10	0	123			2405-8297												2019-12-13	WOS:000500484000056

Batteries are the most used power source for wearable electronics, but unfortunately, they consist of hazardous materials and are bulky, which limit their incorporation into the state-of-art skin-integrated electronics. Sweat-activated biocompatible batteries offer a new powering strategy for skin-like electronics. However, the capacity of the reported sweat-activated batteries (SABs) cannot support real-time data collection and wireless transmission. Focused on this issue, soft, biocompatible, SABs are developed that can be directly integrated on skin with a record high capacity of 42.5 mAh and power density of 7.46 mW cm(-2) among the wearable sweat and body fluids activated batteries. The high performance SABs enable powering electronic devices for a long-term duration, for instance, continuously lighting 120 lighting emitting diodes (LEDs) for over 5 h, and also offers the capability of powering Bluetooth wireless operation for real-time recording of physiological signals for over 6 h. Demonstrations of the SABs for powering microfluidic system based sweat sensors are realized in this work, allowing real-time monitoring of pH, glucose, and Na+ in sweat.									18	1	0	0	0	0	17				2198-3844											2022-02-06	WOS:000747753200001	35088587

However, this may lead to low energy-storage efficiency. Here, we rationally design a charging cycle to maximize energy-storage efficiency by modulating the charge flow in the system, which is demonstrated on a triboelectric nanogenerator by adding a motion-triggered switch. Both theoretical and experimental comparisons show that the designed charging cycle can enhance the charging rate, improve the maximum energy-storage efficiency by up to 50% and promote the saturation voltage by at least a factor of two. This represents a progress to effectively store the energy harvested by nanogenerators with the aim to utilize ambient mechanical energy to drive portable/wearable/implantable electronics.									316	8	0	0	17	1	318			2041-1723												2016-03-01	WOS:000372020100001	26964693

In this paper, we developed stretchable and conductive hydmgels via hybrid double networks approach by combination of rigid physically cross-linked gelatin, tough chemically cross-linked polyacrylamide (PAM) and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) as conducting component. The double networks can be further interlocked by using physical entanglements and abundant dynamic hydrogen bonds, contributing to the improved mechanical properties and self-recovery ability. A transparent and wearable strain sensor is fabricated by sandwiching the hydmgels with two layers of adhesive polyurethane (PU) tape, exhibiting good sensitivity (gauge factor (GF) = 1.58), ultra-wide sensing range of 0-2850% strain, short response time of 200 ms and superior durability and reproducibility (1200 cycles), which endows the sensitive monitors with effective discernibility for detecting intricate human motions. Importantly, the hydrogel-based device can act as a highly stretchable (300% strain) triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG) for efficient energy harvesting, giving a short circuit current (I-SC) of 26.9 mu A, open circuit voltage (V-OC) of 383.8 V and short-circuit transferred charge (Q(SC)) of 92 nC. The integrated abilities of strain sensing and energy harvesting promise the hydrogels for high performance self-powered wearable devices and stretchable power sources.									148	8	2	0	13	0	154			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-10-01	WOS:000571043100006

A Compact, Low-Profile Metasurface-Enabled Antenna for Wearable Medical Body-Area Network Devices								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION				62	8			4021	4030				10.1109/TAP.2014.2327650							Article	AUG 2014	2014	We propose a compact conformal wearable antenna that operates in the 2.36-2.4 GHz medical body-area network band. The antenna is enabled by placing a highly truncated metasurface, consisting of only a two by two array of I-shaped elements, underneath a planar monopole. In contrast to previously reported artificial magnetic conducting ground plane backed antenna designs, here the metasurface acts not only as a ground plane for isolation, but also as the main radiator. An antenna prototype was fabricated and tested, showing a strong agreement between simulation and measurement. Comparing to previously proposed wearable antennas, the demonstrated antenna has a compact form factor of 0.5 lambda(0) x 0.3 lambda(0) x 0.028 lambda(0), all while achieving a 5.5% impedance bandwidth, a gain of 6.2 dBi, and a front-to-back ratio higher than 23 dB. Further numerical and experimental investigations reveal that the performance of the antenna is extraordinarily robust to both structural deformation and human body loading, far superior to both planar monopoles and microstrip patch antennas. Additionally, the introduced metal backed metasurface enables a 95.3% reduction in the specific absorption rate, making such an antenna a prime candidate for incorporation into various wearable devices.									230	2	0	0	1	0	234			0018-926X	1558-2221											2014-09-10	WOS:000340450200014

Many different nanostructured materials, including nanowires, nanoparticles, nanoribbons, carbon black, carbon nanotubes and graphene, have been explored to construct stretchable piezoresistive sensors on an elastomer substrate. Thanks to its unique two-dimensional geometry, lightweight, flexibility, semi-transparency and outstanding transport and mechanical properties, graphene and its derivatives in particular are considered among the most suitable candidates as wearable sensors. This paper reviews various design strategies established for fabricating flexible, wearable sensors using graphene. The current state-of-the-art developments are discussed of flexible sensors made of 1D fibrous, 2D planar and 3D cellular interconnected graphene architectures for detecting physiological strains, tactile pressures and temperatures. The working mechanisms along with existing applications of flexible sensors are presented. The challenges these sensors are currently facing and potential opportunities for novel applications are revealed to offer new insights into future prospects in this field.									182	11	0	0	16	0	187			1369-7021	1873-4103											2020-06-01	WOS:000540750100028

However, it is currently a challenge to fabricate multifunctional and on body healthcare electronic devices with reliable mechanical flexibility, excellent breathability, and self-controllable joule heating effects. Here, we fabricate a multifunctional MXene-based smart fabric by depositing 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets onto cellulose fiber nonwoven fabric via special MXene-cellulose fiber interactions. Such multifunctional fabrics exhibit sensitive and reversible humidity response upon H2O-induced swelling/contraction of channels between the MXene interlayers, enabling wearable respiration monitoring application. Besides, it can also serve as a low-voltage thermotherapy platform due to its fast and stable electro-thermal response. Interestingly, water molecular extraction induces electrical response upon heating, i.e., functioning as a temperature alarm, which allows for real-time temperature monitoring for thermotherapy platform without low-temperature burn risk. Furthermore, metal-like conductivity of MXene renders the fabric an excellent Joule heating effect, which can moderately kill bacteria surrounding the wound in bacteria-infected wound healing therapy. This work introduces a multifunctional smart flexible fabric suitable for next-generation wearable electronic devices for mobile healthcare and personal medical therapy.									188	9	0	0	27	0	191			1936-0851	1936-086X											2020-07-28	WOS:000557762800100	32644797

However, low sensitivity and complex processing of graphene retard the development toward the practical applications. Here, an environment-friendly and cost-effective method to fabricate large-area ultrathin graphene films is proposed for highly sensitive flexible strain sensor. The assembled graphene films are derived rapidly at the liquid/air interface by Marangoni effect and the area can be scaled up. These graphene-based strain sensors exhibit extremely high sensitivity with gauge factor of 1037 at 2% strain, which represents the highest value for graphene platelets at this small deformation so far. This simple fabrication for strain sensors with highly sensitive performance of strain sensor makes it a novel approach to applications in electronic skin, wearable sensors, and health monitoring platforms.									299	22	0	0	17	0	308			1616-301X	1616-3028											2016-03-02	WOS:000372179100002

However, obtaining composites that simultaneously fulfil these requirements is challenging due to a trade-off between conductivity and stretchability. Here, we report on Ag-Au nanocomposites composed of ultralong gold-coated silver nanowires in an elastomeric block-copolymer matrix. Owing to the high aspect ratio and percolation network of the Ag-Au nanowires, the nanocomposites exhibit an optimized conductivity of 41,850 S cm(-1) (maximum of 72,600 S cm(-1)). Phase separation in the Ag-Au nanocomposite during the solvent-drying process generates a microstructure that yields an optimized stretchability of 266% (maximum of 840%). The thick gold sheath deposited on the silver nanowire surface prevents oxidation and silver ion leaching, making the composite biocompatible and highly conductive. Using the nanocomposite, we successfully fabricate wearable and implantable soft bioelectronic devices that can be conformally integrated with human skin and swine heart for continuous electrophysiological recording, and electrical and thermal stimulation.									528	31	0	0	61	0	537			1748-3387	1748-3395											2018-11-01	WOS:000449291700019	30104619

However, current reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based electronic textiles (e-textiles) suffer from poor electrical conductivity and higher power consumption. Here, highly conductive, ultraflexible, and machine washable graphene-based wearable e-textiles are reported. A simple and scalable pad-dry-cure method with subsequent roller compression and a fine encapsulation of graphene flakes is used. The graphene-based wearable e-textiles thus produced provide lowest sheet resistance (approximate to 11.9 omega sq(-1)) ever reported on graphene e-textiles, and highly conductive even after 10 home laundry washing cycles. Moreover, it exhibits extremely high flexibility, bendability, and compressibility as it shows repeatable response in both forward and backward directions before and after home laundry washing cycles. The scalability and multifunctional applications of such highly conductive graphene-based wearable e-textiles are demonstrated as ultraflexible supercapacitor and skin-mounted strain sensors.									150	7	0	0	9	0	150			1616-301X	1616-3028											2020-06-01	WOS:000538154000030

However, it is still a fundamental challenge to balance the trade-offs among the mechanical, electronic, and self-healing properties in CSHs. In this study, we presented supramolecular double-network (DN) CSHs by pre-infiltrating conductive polyaniline (PANI) precursor into the self-healable hydrophobic association poly(acrylic acid) (HAPAA) hydrogel matrix. The dynamic interfacial interactions between the HAPAA and PANI networks efficiently enhanced the mechanical performances of the HAPAA/PANI (PAAN) hydrogel and could compensate for the negative effect of the enhanced mechanical strength on self-healing. In addition, the interconnected PANI network endowed the PAAN hydrogel with high conductivity and excellent sensory performances. As such, the mechanical and electronic properties of the PAAN hydrogel were simultaneously enhanced significantly without compromising the self-healing performance of the HAPAA matrix, achieving balanced mechanical, electronic, and self-healing properties in the PAAN hydrogel. Lastly, proof-of-concept applications like human physiological monitoring electronics, flexible touch screens, and artificial electronic skin are successfully demonstrated using the PAAN hydrogel with the capability of restoring their electronic performances after the healing process. It is anticipated that such hydrogel network design can be extended into next-generation hydrogel electronics for human-machine-interfaces and soft robotics.									104	5	0	0	11	0	107			2051-6347	2051-6355											2021-04-20	WOS:000639836300001	34846508

With the increasing interest in portable and wearable electronic equipment, various flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) and flexible electrodes (FEs) have been investigated widely and constantly in recent years. Currently-developed FEs/FSCs exhibit myriad physical forms and functional features and form a complicated and extensive system. Herein, we summarize the recent results about FEs/FSCs and present this review by categories. According to different micro-structures and macroscopic patterns, the existing FEs/FSCs can be divided into three types: fiber-like FEs/FSCs; paper-like FEs/FSCs; and three-dimensional porous FEs (and corresponding FSCs). Subsequently each type of the FEs/FSCs is further sub-classified based on their construction rules, and mechanical and electrochemical properties. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such a hierarchical and detailed classification strategy has been propose. We believe it will be beneficial for researchers around the world to understand FEs/FSCs. In addition, we bring up some fresh ideas for the future development of wearable energy storage devices.									440	27	0	0	12	1	450			2050-7488	2050-7496											2016-01-01	WOS:000372754000002

Due to the presence of micropores within the elastomeric dielectric layer, our piezocapacitive pressure sensor is highly deformable by even very small amounts of pressure, leading to a dramatic increase in its sensitivity. Moreover, the gradual closure of micropores under compression increases the effective dielectric constant, thereby further enhancing the sensitivity of the sensor. The 3-D microporous dielectric layer with serially stacked springs of elastomer bridges can cover a much wider pressure range than those of previously reported micro-/nanostructured sensing materials. We also investigate the applicability of our sensor to wearable pressure-sensing devices as an electronic pressure-sensing skin in robotic fingers as well as a bandage-type pressure-sensing device for pulse monitoring at the human wrist. Finally, we demonstrate a pressure sensor array pad for the recognition of spatially distributed pressure information on a plane. Our sensor, with its excellent pressure-sensing performance, marks the realization of a true tactile pressure sensor presenting highly sensitive responses to the entire tactile pressure range, from ultralow-force detection to high weights generated by human activity.									333	14	0	0	16	0	337			1944-8244	1944-8252											2016-07-06	WOS:000379456000047	27286001

The essential part of the IoT is communication between devices, which requires radio-frequency (RF) antennas. Metals are widely used for antennas; however, their bulkiness limits the fabrication of thin, lightweight, and flexible antennas. Recently, nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and conductive polymers came into play. However, poor conductivity limits their use. We show RF devices for wireless communication based on metallic two-dimensional (2D) titaniumcarbide (MXene) prepared by a single-step spray coating. We fabricated a similar to 100-nm-thick translucent MXene antenna with a reflection coefficient of less than -10 dB. By increasing the antenna thickness to 8 mm, we achieved a reflection coefficient of -65 dB. We also fabricated a 1-mu m-thick MXene RF identification device tag reaching a reading distance of 8 m at 860 MHz. Our finding shows that 2D titanium carbide MXene operates below the skin depth of copper or other metals as well as offers an opportunity to produce transparent antennas. Being the most conductive, as well as water-dispersible, among solution-processed 2Dmaterials, MXenes open new avenues for manufacturing various classes of RF and other portable, flexible, and wearable electronic devices.									281	7	0	0	16	0	282			2375-2548												2018-09-01	WOS:000449224000054	30255151

The high sensitivity over a wide linear range combined with long-term durability is a critical requirement for the fabrication of reliable pressure sensors for versatile applications. Herein, we propose a special approach to enhance the sensitivity and linearity range of a capacitive pressure sensor by fabricating a hybrid ionic nanofibrous membrane as a sensing layer composed of Ti3C2Tx MXene and an ionic salt of lithium sulfonamides in a poly(vinyl alcohol) elastomer matrix. The reversible ion pumping triggered by a hydrogen bond in the hybrid sensing layer leads to high sensitivities of 5.5 and 1.5 kPa(-1) in the wide linear ranges of 0-30 and 30-250 kPa, respectively, and a fast response time of 70.4 ms. In addition, the fabricated sensor exhibits a minimum detection limit of 2 Pa and high durability over 20 000 continuous cycles even under a high pressure of 45 kPa. These results indicate that the proposed sensor can be potentially used in mobile medical monitoring devices and next-generation artificial e-skin.									100	6	0	0	9	0	102			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-01-14	WOS:000634569100057	33444498

However, sweat-based sensing still poses several challenges, including easy degradation of enzymes and biomaterials with repeated testing, limited detection range and sensitivity of enzyme-based biosensors caused by oxygen deficiency in sweat, and poor shelf life of sensors using all-in-one working electrodes patterned by traditional techniques (e.g., electrodeposition and screen printing). Herein, a stretchable, wearable, and modular multifunctional biosensor is developed, incorporating a novel MXene/Prussian blue (Ti3C2Tx/PB) composite designed for durable and sensitive detection of biomarkers (e.g., glucose and lactate) in sweat. A unique modular design enables a simple exchange of the specific sensing electrode to target the desired analytes. Furthermore, an implemented solid-liquid-air three-phase interface design leads to superior sensor performance and stability. Typical electrochemical sensitivities of 35.3 mu A mm(-1) cm(-2) for glucose and 11.4 mu A mm(-1) cm(-2) for lactate are achieved using artificial sweat. During in vitro perspiration monitoring of human subjects, the physiochemistry signals (glucose and lactate level) can be measured simultaneously with high sensitivity and good repeatability. This approach represents an important step toward the realization of ultrasensitive enzymatic wearable biosensors for personalized health monitoring.									211	13	0	0	29	0	215			1613-6810	1613-6829											2019-05-01	WOS:000472198100018	30957964

Here we report a stretchable strain sensor with outstanding thermal management. Besides a high stretchability and sensitivity testified by human motion monitoring, as well as long-term durability, an enhanced thermal conductivity from the casted thermoplastic polyurethane-boron nitride nanosheets layer helps rapid heat transmission to the environments, while the porous electrospun fibrous thermoplastic polyurethane membrane leads to thermal insulation. A 32% drop of the real time saturated temperature is achieved. For the first time we in-situ investigated the dynamic operational temperature fluctuation of stretchable electronics under repeating stretching-releasing processes. Finally, cytotoxicity test confirms that the nanofillers are tightly restricted in the nanocomposites, making it harmless to human health. All the results prove it an excellent candidate for the next-generation of wearable devices. Though stretchable strain sensors are attractive for next-generation applications due to their high sensitivity, heat generated in these devices limits their reliability.

In this context, textiles can be seen as a promising platform for the integration of wearable chemical sensors due to their inherent breathability, flexibility, softness and comfortableness. Gold is regarded as a preferred active sensing material due to its excellent biocompatibility, chemical inertness and wide electrochemical window. Here, a dry-spinning method was used to fabricate stretchable, strain-insensitive and highly conductive gold fibers. Such gold fibers could be used to fabricate lactate-sensing working electrodes, reference electrode, counter electrodes and further weaved into textiles in a standard three-electrode system with a planar layout. The textile lactate biosensors showed a high sensitivity of 19.13 mu A/mM cm(2) in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and 14.6 mu A/mM cm(2) in artificial sweat. This sensitivity could be maintained under high tensile strain up to 100% without external structural design.

However, increased life expectancy combined with falling birth rates are expected to engender a large aging demographic in the near future that would impose significant burdens on the socio-economic structure of these countries.

The article provides a brief introduction to graphene-based materials and their potential applications in flexible and stretchable wearable electronic devices. The role of graphene in fabricating flexible gas sensors for the detection of various hazardous gases, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H-2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and humidity in wearable technology, is discussed.

Herein, we present a breathable and flexible all-nanofiber iontronic pressure sensor with various merits of high-pressure sensitivity, excellent ultraviolet (UV)-shielding, self-cleaning, and antibacterial performances. The fabricated pressure sensor is assembled by three layers of breathable electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofiber films. The inner layer, which is constructed by TPU nanofibers loaded with ionic liquid, offers free ions to enhance the capacitance intensity because of the formation of interfacial electric double layer, thus increasing the pressure sensitivity of the sensor. The as-prepared iontronic flexible pressure sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 6.21 kPa(-1), wide working range from 23 Pa to 120 kPa, fast response time of 170 ms and recovery time of 135 ms, and excellent stability over 6000 loading/unloading cycles. More interestingly, nano-TiO2 is filled in the TPU nanofibers of the two outer layers, endowing the pressure sensors with excellent UV-shielding, self-cleaning, and antibacterial performances, which are the ideal merits for wearable electronics. By virtue of these remarkable performances, the sensor could be employed in human psychological signal monitoring and wearable encrypted information transmission system, exhibiting great potential in wearable electronics.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2211-2855	2211-3282											2022-04-28	WOS:000783550300001

The key to realizing those functionalities is essentially the fabrication of conductive electrodes with desirable mechanical properties. Conductive polymers (CPs) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have emerged to be the most promising flexible electrode materials over rigid metallic oxides and play a critical role in these unprecedented devices as transparent electrodes, hole transport layers, interconnectors, electroactive layers, or motion-sensing conductors. Here, the current status of research on PEDOT:PSS is summarized including various approaches to boosting the electrical conductivity and mechanical compliance and stability, directly linked to the underlying mechanism of the performance enhancements. Along with the basic principles, the most cutting edge-progresses in devices with PEDOT:PSS are highlighted. Meanwhile, the advantages and plausible problems of the CPs and as-fabricated devices are pointed out. Finally, new perspectives are given for CP modifications and device fabrications. This work stresses the importance of developing CP films and reveals their critical role in the evolution of these next-generation devices featuring wearable, deformable, printable, ultrathin, and see-through characteristics.									418	18	0	0	25	0	424				2198-3844											2019-07-30	WOS:000477927000001	31592415

Here, a bifiller of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (GR) for filling flexible porous polydimethylsiloxane (CNT-GR/PDMS) nanocomposites is designed and prepared for strain-sensing applications. The typical microporous structure was successfully constructed using the Soxhlet extraction technique, and the connected CNTs and GR constructed a perfect three-dimensional conductive network in the porous skeleton. As a result, the stretchability and sensitivity of the CNT-GR/PDMS-based strain sensors were well regulated based on the porous structure and the typical synergistic conductive network. Based on the destruction effect of the brittle synergistic conductive network located in the outer and inner layers of the cell skeleton and the contact effect between adjacent cells in different strain ranges, the prepared CNTs-GR/PDMS-based strain sensor exhibited superior gauge factors of 182.5, 45.6, 70.2, and 186.5 in the 0-3, 3-57, 57-90, and 90-120% strain regions, respectively. In addition, this material also exhibited an ultralow detection limit (0.5% strain), a fast response time (60 ms), good stability and durability (10,000 cycles), and frequency-/strain-dependent sensing performances, making it active for the detection of various external environments. Finally, the prepared porous CNTs-GR/PDMS-based strain sensor was attached to the skin to detect various human motions, such as wrist bending, finger bending, elbow bending, and knee bending, thereby demonstrating wide application prospects in smart wearable devices.									77	4	0	0	3	0	79			1944-8244	1944-8252											2021-06-01	WOS:000639014900073	33760608

First, since e-skin will be exposed to prolonged stresses of various kinds and needs to be conformally adhered to irregularly shaped surfaces, materials with intrinsic stretchability and self-healing properties are of great importance. Second, tactile sensing capability such as the detection of pressure, strain, slip, force vector, and temperature are important for health monitoring in skin attachable devices, and to enable object manipulation and detection of surrounding environment for robotics and prosthetics. For skin attachable devices, chemical and electrophysiological sensing and wireless signal communication are of high significance to fully gauge the state of health of users and to ensure user comfort. For robotics and prosthetics, large-area integration on 3D surfaces in a facile and scalable manner is critical. Furthermore, new signal processing strategies using neuromorphic devices are needed to efficiently process tactile information in a parallel and low power manner. For prosthetics, neural interfacing electrodes are of high importance. These topics are discussed, focusing on progress, current challenges, and future prospects.									789	47	0	0	67	0	802			0935-9648	1521-4095											2019-09-19	WOS:000487420500001	31538370

In this review, we summarize the recent research progress of flexible lithium-ion batteries, with special emphasis on electrode material selectivity and battery structural design. We begin with a brief introduction of flexible lithium-ion batteries and the current development of flexible solid-state electrolytes for applications in this field. This is followed by a detailed overview of the recent progress on flexible electrode materials based on carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon cloth, conductive paper (cellulose), textiles and some other low-dimensional nanostructured materials.

We propose a hybridized self-charging power textile system with the aim of simultaneously collecting outdoor sunshine and random body motion energies and then storing them in an energy storage unit. Both of the harvested energies can be easily converted into electricity by using fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells (for solar energy) and fiber-shaped triboelectric nanogenerators (for random body motion energy) and then further stored as chemical energy in fiber-shaped supercapacitors. Because of the all-fiber-shaped structure of the entire system, our proposed hybridized self-charging textile system can be easily woven into electronic textiles to fabricate smart clothes to sustainably operate mobile or wearable electronics.									648	32	0	0	29	0	654			2375-2548												2016-10-01	WOS:000387991500005	27819039

In this work, a superhydrophobic strain sensor based on conductive thermoplastic polyurethane/carbon nanotubes/polydimethylsiloxane (TPU/CNTs/PDMS) was prepared by ultrasonication induced CNTs decoration onto the electrospun TPU nanofiber surface, followed by the PDMS modification. Uniformly dispersed CNTs on the nanofiber surface with a hierarchical structure construct the conductive network. The PDMS layer with a low surface energy endows the nanofiber composite with superhydrophobicity thus anti-corrosion property. The introduction of CNTs/PDMS improves both the Young's modulus, tensile strength and the elongation at break. The superhydrophobicity and conductivity can be maintained after the cyclic stretching-releasing test, displaying excellent durability. When used as a wearable strain sensor, the nanofiber composite is capable of detecting body motion and could work even under harsh conditions (moisture, acid and alkaline environment), showing promising application in wearable electronics.									226	14	0	0	31	0	229			1385-8947	1873-3212											2019-02-19	WOS:000457863500010

We report a soft skin-like triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG) that enables both biomechanical energy harvesting and tactile sensing by hybridizing elastomer and ionic hydrogel as the electrification layer and electrode, respectively. For the first time, ultrahigh stretchability (uniaxial strain, 1160%) and transparency (average transmittance, 96.2% for visible light) are achieved simultaneously for an energy-harvesting device. The soft TENG is capable of outputting alternative electricity with an instantaneous peak power density of 35 mW m(-2) and driving wearable electronics (for example, an electronic watch) with energy converted from human motions, whereas the STENG is pressuresensitive, enabling its application as artificial electronic skin for touch/pressure perception. Our work provides new opportunities for multifunctional power sources and potential applications in soft/wearable electronics.									855	42	0	0	60	0	867			2375-2548												2017-05-01	WOS:000419752300014	28580425

To date, researchers have made dramatic breakthroughs in achieving high-performance thermoelectrics; however, the figure of merit ZT of conducting polymers is still far below that of the high-performance thermoelectric Bi2Te3-based alloys at room temperature. This challenge lies in the complex interrelation between electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. In this review, we overview the state-of-the-art on conducting polymers and their thermoelectric devices, starting with the summary of the fundamentals as well as several well-accepted theoretical models. Furthermore, this review examines the key factors determining the charge transport mechanisms in this family of materials and previously reported optimization strategies are discussed and classified.

As a bridge between wearable electronics and their surrounding environment and users, sensors are core components of WIEs and determine the implementation of their many functions. Although the existing sensor technology has evolved to a very advanced level with the rapid progress of advanced materials and nanotechnology, most of them still need external power supply, like batteries, which could cause problems that are difficult to track, recycle, and miniaturize, as well as possible environmental pollution and health hazards. In the past decades, based upon piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and triboelectric effect, various kinds of nanogenerators (NGs) were proposed which are capable of responding to a variety of mechanical movements, such as breeze, body drive, muscle stretch, sound/ultrasound, noise, mechanical vibration, and blood flow, and they had been widely used as self-powered sensors and micro-nanoenergy and blue energy harvesters. This review focuses on the applications of self-powered generators as implantable and wearable sensors in health monitoring, biosensor, human-computer interaction, and other fields.

Progress in new technologies has led the development of a series of devices and techniques which allow for objective evaluation, making measurements more efficient and effective and providing specialists with reliable information. Firstly, an introduction of the key gait parameters and semi-subjective methods is presented. Secondly, technologies and studies on the different objective methods are reviewed. Finally, based on the latest research, the characteristics of each method are discussed. 40% of the reviewed articles published in late 2012 and 2013 were related to non-wearable systems, 37.5% presented inertial sensor-based systems, and the remaining 22.5% corresponded to other wearable systems.

However, the operation of synthetic circuits generally requires the presence of living, engineered bacteria, which has limited their application in wearables. Here we report lightweight, flexible substrates and textiles functionalized with freeze-dried, cell-free synthetic circuits, including CRISPR-based tools, that detect metabolites, chemicals and pathogen nucleic acid signatures. The wearable devices are activated upon rehydration from aqueous exposure events and report the presence of specific molecular targets by colorimetric changes or via an optical fiber network that detects fluorescent and luminescent outputs. The detection limits for nucleic acids rival current laboratory methods such as quantitative PCR. We demonstrate the development of a face mask with a lyophilized CRISPR sensor for wearable, noninvasive detection of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature within 90 min, requiring no user intervention other than the press of a button.									158	11	0	0	58	0	166			1087-0156	1546-1696											2021-07-13	WOS:000667605500002	34183860

Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods.Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety.Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24-68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study.Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = -0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035). A combined model of smartphone and wearable features and self-reported mood provided the strongest prediction of depression.Conclusion: The current findings demonstrate that wearable devices may provide valuable sources of data in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety, most notably data related to common measures of sleep.									48	0	0	0	5	0	47			1664-0640												2021-03-02	WOS:000616831400001	33584388

Textile fabrics have been widely used to fabricate flexible strain sensors owing to their high flexibility. However, the elasticity of ordinary textile fabrics is low, which limits their strain sensing range. In this article, we used a simple method to fabricate flexible strain sensing fabrics (FSSFs) through the coating of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on elastic nylon/polyurethane (nylon/PU) fabric, followed by reduction of GO with sodium borohydride. The reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets were adsorbed on the elastic fabrics to impart electrical conductivity to the fabrics. The coated fabrics were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman scattering spectroscopy. The electromechanical performance and strain sensing properties of the FSSF were investigated. The fabricated strain sensor exhibited high sensitivity, a large workable strain range (0-30%), fast response and great stability. The mechanical property of fabrics did not change remarkably after the treatment with RGO. The surface resistance of the RGO/nylon/PU only increased from similar to 112 K Omega/m(2) to similar to 154 K Omega/m(2) after 8 washing cycles, exhibiting good washability. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of human motions, such as bending of finger and rotation of wrist, was achieved by the as-prepared FSSF. The RGO/nylon/PU fabrics as flexible strain sensors have potential applications in wearable electronic devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The recent development of intrinsically stretchable conductors and semiconductors has enabled highly mechanically robust and skin-conformable electronic circuits or optoelectronic devices(2,5-10). However, their operating frequencies have been limited to less than 100 hertz, which is much lower than that required for many applications. Here we report intrinsically stretchable diodes-based on stretchable organic and nanomaterials-capable of operating at a frequency as high as 13.56 megahertz. This operating frequency is high enough for the wireless operation of soft sensors and electrochromic display pixels using radiofrequency identification in which the base-carrier frequency is 6.78 megahertz or 13.56 megahertz. This was achieved through a combination of rational material design and device engineering. Specifically, we developed a stretchable anode, cathode, semiconductor and current collector that can satisfy the strict requirements for high-frequency operation. Finally, we show the operational feasibility of our diode by integrating it with a stretchable sensor, electrochromic display pixel and antenna to realize a stretchable wireless tag. This work is an important step towards enabling enhanced functionalities and capabilities for skin-like wearable electronics.									81	1	0	0	3	0	81			0028-0836	1476-4687											2021-12-22	WOS:000728238900017	34880427

The design is inspired by the biological musculoskeletal system of the human foot and lower leg, mimicking the morphology and the functionality of the biological muscle-tendon-ligament structure. A key feature of the device is its soft structure that provides active assistance without restricting natural degrees of freedom at the ankle joint. Four pneumatic artificial muscles assist dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as inversion and eversion. The prototype is also equipped with various embedded sensors for gait pattern analysis. For the subject tested, the prototype is capable of generating an ankle range of motion of 27 (14 dorsiflexion and 13 plantarflexion). The controllability of the system is experimentally demonstrated using a linear time-invariant (LTI) controller. The controller is found using an identified LTI model of the system, resulting from the interaction of the soft orthotic device with a human leg, and model-based classical control design techniques. The suitability of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated with several angle-reference following experiments.									322	16	1	0	20	0	332			1748-3182	1748-3190											2014-03-01	WOS:000331169300008	24434598

However, small specific capacitance and low operating voltage limit the practical application of fiber-shaped supercapacitors in high energy density devices. Herein, direct growth of ultrathin MnO2 nanosheet arrays on conductive carbon fibers with robust adhesion is exhibited, which exhibit a high specific capacitance of 634.5 Fg(-1) at a current density of 2.5 A g(-1) and possess superior cycle stability. When MnO2 nanosheet arrays on carbon fibers and graphene on carbon fibers are used as a positive electrode and a negative electrode, respectively, in an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), the ASC displays a high specific capacitance of 87.1 Fg(-1) and an exceptional energy density of 27.2 Wh kg(-1). In addition, its capacitance retention reaches 95.2% over 3000 cycles, representing the excellent cyclic ability. The flexibility and mechanical stability of these ASCs are highlighted by the negligible degradation of their electrochemical performance even under severely bending states. Impressively, as-prepared fiber-shaped ASCs could successfully power a photodetector based on CdS nanowires without applying any external bias voltage. The excellent performance of all-solid-state ASCs opens up new opportunity for development of wearable and self-powered nanodevices in near future.									393	23	0	0	23	0	402			1614-6832	1614-6840											2016-01-01	WOS:000368849200005

To adapt to wearable electronics with arbitrary configurations, it is highly desirable to develop editable supercapacitors that can be directly transferred into desirable shapes and stretchability. In this work, editable supercapacitors for customizable shapes and stretchability using electrodes based on mechanically strengthened ultralong MnO2 nanowire composites are developed. A supercapacitor edited with honeycomb-like structure shows a specific capacitance of 227.2 mF cm(-2) and can be stretched up to 500% without degradation of electrochemical performance, which is superior to most of the state-of-the-art stretchable supercapacitors. In addition, it maintains nearly 98% of the initial capacitance after 10 000 stretch-and-release cycles under 400% tensile strain. As a representative of concept for system integration, the editable supercapacitors are integrated with a strain sensor, and the system exhibits a stable sensing performance even under arm swing. Being highly stretchable, easily programmable, as well as connectable in series and parallel, an editable supercapacitor with customizable stretchability is promising to produce stylish energy storage devices to power various portable, stretchable, and wearable devices.									297	20	0	0	14	0	301			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-01-11	WOS:000419454800014	29134702

However, to date, the poor stretchability and sensitivity of conventional metals or inorganic semiconductor-based strain sensors have restricted their application in this field to some extent, and hence many efforts have been devoted to find suitable candidates to overcome these limitations. Recently, novel resistive-type electrically conductive polymer composites (ECPCs)-based strain sensors have attracted attention based on their merits of light weight, flexibility, stretchability, and easy processing, thus showing great potential applications in the fields of human movement detection, artificial muscles, human-machine interfaces, soft robotic skin, etc. For ECPCs-based strain sensors, the conductive filler type and the phase morphology design have important influences on the sensing property. Meanwhile, to achieve a successful application toward wearable devices, several imperative features, including a self-healing capability, superhydrophobicity, and good light transmission, need to be considered. The aim of the present review is to critically review the progress of ECPCs-based strain sensors and to foresee their future development.									439	29	0	0	27	0	451			2050-7526	2050-7534											2018-12-07	WOS:000451073200001

Current challenges remain in the combination of high output performance, functionalization, and importantly wearing comfort. Herein, an all-fiber hybrid piezoelectric-enhanced triboelectric nanogenerator fabricated by electrospinning silk fibroin and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers on conductive fabrics is presented. Due to the large specific surface area of nanofibers and the extraordinary ability of silk fibroin to donate electrons in triboelectrification, the hybrid nanogenerator shows outstanding electrical performance, with a power density of 310 mu W/cm(2). This novel all-fiber configuration provides all benefits of ordinary fabrics having flexible appearance and good air permeability, and moreover it can be custom embedded in clothes in any desirable size and shape. Furthermore, the fabricated device allows identifying various types of body motion by a correlation between gesture and corresponding electrical signal.

Here we introduce a wearable sensor capable of simultaneously measuring both respiration rate and volume with high fidelity. Our disposable respiration sensor with a Band-Aid (c) like formfactor can measure both respiration rate and volume by simply measuring the local strain of the ribcage and abdomen during breathing. We demonstrate that both metrics are highly correlated to measurements from a medical grade continuous spirometer on participants at rest. Additionally, we also show that the system is capable of detecting respiration under various ambulatory conditions. Because these low-powered piezo-resistive sensors can be integrated with wireless Bluetooth units, they can be useful in monitoring patients with chronic respiratory diseases in everyday settings.									148	4	0	0	22	0	148			2398-6352												2019-04-05	WOS:000462449900001	31304358

Furthermore, the merits of excellent waterproof property, self-cleaning, and anti-corrosion are also imperative for the practical applications of them. Herein, a tunable wearable micro-cracked non-woven fabrics (NWF) strain sensor with broad strain sensing range and high sensitivity was successfully developed based on the electrically conductive cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)/graphene (G) coating with controllable micro-crack density, which was achieved through changing the G loading of the coating layer, and its superhydrophobicity was achieved by simply dip-coating in the hydrophobic fumed silica (Hf-SiO2)/ethanol dispersion. As a result, a broad working range of 98% and GF value up to 2.36 x 10(4) are simultaneously achieved for the prepared strain sensor (G content is 25 wt%). In addition, it possesses an ultralow detection limit as low as 0.1%, short response time (33 ms) and good sensing stability over 1000 cycles. What's more, the NWF strain sensor presents excellent waterproofness (WCA =154 degrees), anti-corrosion ability, outstanding self-cleaning and stability. Due to the excellent response performances, the NWF strain sensor can successfully monitor various human activities from subtle deformations (e.g. speech recognition, pulse waves) to vigorous body movements (e.g. finger, elbow joint and wrist movement). Specially, owing to its excellent superhydrophobic characteristic, the strain sensor also exhibits superior self-cleaning capability and good applicability in a humid or underwater harsh outdoor environment.									220	13	0	0	26	0	223			2211-2855	2211-3282											2019-12-01	WOS:000503062400063

Herein, the pre-intercalation of Zn2+ which gives rise to a highly stable tunnel structure of ZnxMnO2 in nanowire form that are grown on flexible carbon cloth with a disruptively large mass loading of 12 mg cm(-2) is reported. More interestingly, the ZnxMnO2 nanowires of tunnel structure enable an ultrahigh areal energy density and power density, when they are employed as the cathode in Zn-HSCs. The achieved areal capacitance of up to 1745.8 mF cm(-2) at 2 mA cm(-2), and the remarkable areal energy density of 969.9 mu Wh cm(-2) are comparable favorably with those of Zn-ion batteries. When integrated into a quasi-solid-state device, they also endow outstanding mechanical flexibility. The truly battery-level Zn-HSCs are timely in filling up of the battery-supercapacitor gap, and promise applications in the new generation flexible and wearable devices.									139	14	0	0	3	0	142			1613-6810	1613-6829											2020-04-09	WOS:000538008500012	32174015

The introduction of organic semiconductors in the devices can soften the boundaries between microelectronic systems and dynamically active cells and tissues. Therefore, organic bioelectronics has attracted much attention recently due to the unique properties and promising applications. Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), owing to their inherent capability of amplifying received signals, have emerged as one of the state-of-the-art biosensing platforms. The advantages of organic semiconductors in terms of synthetic freedom, low temperature solution processing, biocompatibility, and mechanical flexibility render OTFTs ideal transducers for wearable electronics, e-skin, and implantable devices. How to realize highly sensitive, selective, rapid, and efficient signal capture and extraction of biological recognition events is the major challenge in the design of biosensors. OTFTs are prone to converting the presence or change of target analytes into specific electrical signals even in complex biological systems. More importantly, OTFT sensors can be conveniently functionalized with chemical or biological modifications and exhibit substantially improved device sensitivity and selectivity as well as other analytical figure of merits, including calibration range, linearity, and accuracy. However, the stability and reproducibility of the organic devices need to be further improved.In this Account, we first introduce the unique features of OTFTs for bioelectronic applications. Two typical OTFT configurations, including organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) and electrolyte gated organic field effect transistor (EGOFET), are highlighted in their sensing applications mainly due to the operation of the devices in electrolytes and the combination of ionic and electronic charge transports in the devices. These devices are potentiometric transducers with low working voltages (<1 V) and high sensitivity, and are thus suitable for wearable applications with low power consumption. Second, the functionalization strategies on channel materials, electrolytes, and gate electrodes based on various modification methods and sensing mechanisms are discussed in sequence. In an OECT- or EGOFET-based biosensor, the device performance is particularly sensitive to the physical properties of the two interfaces, including channel/electrolyte and gate/electrolyte interfaces. Any change in the potential drop or capacitance of either interface can influence the channel current substantially. Therefore, the functionalization of the interfaces is critical to the sensing performance. In particular, when an electrochemically active material is modified on the interfaces, the reaction of the analyte catalyzed by the modified material can influence the interface potential and lead to a channel current response much stronger than that of a conventional electrochemical measurement. So the biosensors are much more sensitive than typical analytical methods due to the signal amplification of the transistors.Third, the processing techniques including screen printing and inkjet printing and the possibility for mass production are discussed. The applications of organic transistors in wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring systems, especially the fabric OECT-based biosensors for noninvasive detection, are presented. It is expected that the versatile organic transistors will enable various compact, flexible and disposable biosensors compatible with wearable electronics.									177	6	0	0	23	0	179			0001-4842	1520-4898											2019-02-01	WOS:000459642900001	30620566

Here, a self-powered, highly stretchable, and transparent triboelectric tactile sensor with patterned Ag-nanofiber electrodes for detecting and spatially mapping trajectory profiles is reported. The Ag-nanofiber electrodes demonstrate high transparency (>70%), low sheet resistance (1.68-11.1 (-1)), excellent stretchability, and stability (>100% strain). Based on the electrode patterning and device design, an 8 x 8 triboelectric sensor matrix is fabricated, which works well under high strain owing to the effect of the electrostatic induction. Using cross-locating technology, the device can execute more rapid tactile mapping, with a response time of 70 ms. In addition, the object being detected can be made from any commonly used materials or can even be human hands, indicating that this device has widespread potential in tactile sensing and touchpad technology applications.									271	24	0	0	11	0	280			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-03-22	WOS:000428348000025	29411908

To date, it is still a great challenge to fabricate strain sensors with both large workable strain range and high sensitivity. Cotton is an abundant supplied natural material composed of cellulose fibers and has been widely used for textiles and clothing. In this work, the fabrication of highly sensitive wearable strain sensors based on commercial plain weave cotton fabric, which is the most popular fabric for clothes, is demonstrated through a low-cost and scalable process. The strain sensors based on carbonized cotton fabric exhibit fascinating performance, including large workable strain range (> 140%), superior sensitivity (gauge factor of 25 in strain of 0%-80% and that of 64 in strain of 80%-140%), inconspicuous drift, and long-term stability, simultaneously offering advantages of low cost and simplicity in device fabrication and versatility in applications. Notably, the strain sensor can detect a subtle strain of as low as 0.02%. Based on its superior performance, its applications in monitoring both vigorous and subtle human motions are demonstrated, showing its tremendous potential for applications in wearable electronics and intelligent robots.									343	24	0	0	23	0	348			1616-301X	1616-3028											2018-12-28	WOS:000391923000019

The resulting sensors combine advantages of electronic and microfluidic functionality in a platform that is significantly lighter, cheaper, and smaller than alternatives. A demonstration device simultaneously monitors sweat rate/loss, pH, lactate, glucose, and chloride. Systematic studies of the electronics, microfluidics, and integration schemes establish the key design considerations and performance attributes. Two-day human trials that compare concentrations of glucose and lactate in sweat and blood suggest a potential basis for noninvasive, semi-quantitative tracking of physiological status.									361	20	0	0	70	0	369			2375-2548												2019-02-15	WOS:000457547900059	30746477

Microneedles technologies have recently emerged as powerful tools for transdermal applications with inherent painlessness and biosafety. In this work, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, a fully integrated wearable closed-loop system (IWCS) based on mini-invasive microneedle platform is developed for in situ diabetic sensing and treatment. The IWCS consists of three connected modules: 1) a mesoporous microneedle-reverse iontophoretic glucose sensor; 2) a flexible printed circuit board as integrated and control; and 3) a microneedle-iontophoretic insulin delivery component. As the key component, mesoporous microneedles enable the painless penetration of stratum corneum, implementing subcutaneous substance exchange. The coupling with iontophoresis significantly enhances glucose extraction and insulin delivery and enables electrical control. This IWCS is demonstrated to accurately monitor glucose fluctuations, and responsively deliver insulin to regulate hyperglycemia in diabetic rat model. The painless microneedles and wearable design endows this IWCS as a highly promising platform to improve the therapies of diabetic patients.									47	7	0	0	13	0	48				2198-3844											2021-06-15	WOS:000657398900001	34081407

In the present work, superelastic MXene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels are fabricated by mixing MXene and GO flakes, followed by a multistep reduction of GO, freeze-casting, and finally an annealing process. By optimizing both the composition and reducing conditions, the resultant aerogel shows a reversible compressive strain of 95%, surpassing all current reported values. The conducting MXene/rGO network provides fast electron transfer and stable structural integrity under compression/release cycles. When assembled into compressible supercapacitors, 97.2% of the capacitance was retained after 1000 compression/release cycles. Moreover, the high conductivity and porous structure also enabled the fabrication of a piezoresistive sensor with high sensitivity (0.28 kPa(-1)), wide detection range (up to 66.98 kPa), and ultralow detection limit (similar to 60 Pa). It is envisaged that the superelasticity of MXene/rGO aerogels offers a versatile platform for utilizing MXene-based materials in a wide array of applications including wearable electronics, electromagnetic interference shielding, and flexible energy storage devices.									82	1	0	0	7	0	81			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-02-26	WOS:000634569100109	33635074

Here, a superhydrophobic and stretchable nanofiber composite is prepared by acid modified carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) decoration onto the polyurethane (PU)/polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) nanofibers, followed by the hydrolysis of methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) on the ACNT surface. The introduction of ACNTs and hydrolysate of MTS, namely the polysiloxane, significantly improves the mechanical properties of the blend nanofibrous membrane including the Young's modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break. The superhydrophobicity can be maintained even under corrosive conditions. When served as the chemical vapor sensor, the nanofiber composite displays good selectivity, high sensitivity and low detection limit (1 ppm for the toluene vapor). Also, the nanofiber composite can be used as wearable strain sensors that can detect various body motions. The multifunctional nanofiber composite has potential applications in wearable electronic, electrical nose for gas leakage and smart textile.									115	8	0	0	15	1	118			1385-8947	1873-3212											2019-12-10	WOS:000499066900169

Among them, crack-based flexible strain sensors have been studied extensively owing to their ultrahigh sensitivity. Nevertheless, the detection range of a crack-based sensor is quite narrow, limiting its application. In this work, a stretchable strain sensor based on a designed crack structure was fabricated by spray-coating carbon nanotube (CNT) ink onto an electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibrous mat and prestretching treatment to overcome the trade-off relationship. Our sensor exhibited combined features of high sensitivity in a greatly widened workable sensing range [a gauge factor of 428.5 within 100% strain, 9268.8 for a strain of 100-220%, and larger than 83982.8 for a strain of 220-300%], a fast response time (about 70 ms), superior durability (>10 000 stretching-releasing cycles), and excellent response toward bending. The microstructural evolution of CNT branches extending from two edges of the cracks and the excellent stretchability of TPU fibrous mats are mainly related to the remarkable sensing properties. Our sensor is then assembled to detect various human motions and physical vibrational signals, demonstrating its potential applications in intelligent devices, electronic skins, and wearable healthcare monitors.									180	11	0	0	6	0	182			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-02-20	WOS:000459642200078	30698944

The IoE may alter how we live, work, and interact with many untethered things in a wide range of applications, including personal devices, home appliances, and industry. A key requirement for its successful widespread adoption is secure performance in various applications of data and power management. In this regard, supercapacitors play an important role as a real-time backup power supply and micro-power source for the embedded electronics. In particular, they are ideal for the next-generation of portable and wearable electronics that require lightweight, robust, flexible, reliable, and environmentally benign electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices. Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) have emerged as an important class of EES device. They have advantages such as high-power density, high specific capacity, long-term cycling stability, and safety. For the portable and flexible IoE smart devices, flexible solid-state hybrid supercapacitors (FSHSCs) provide an attractive solution to overcome the poor readiness in terms of immediate power supply and auxiliary energy source. However, there are still a few major challenges including suitable electrode materials, electrolytes, and the configuration design to achieve a satisfactory energy density, bendability, twistability, mechanical durability, and safety that need to be met before FSHSCs can be fully deployed. In this review paper, after briefly describing the development history of supercapacitors, we focus on recent research progress in FSHSCs for portable and/or wearable devices, classified according to the structures (yarn-, sheet-, and micro-structured types). This is followed by a discussion of the micro-type FSHSCs for miniaturized interdigitation, categorized on the basis of the fabrication methods, including masking, inkjet screening, and 3D ink printing. The article concludes with a discussion of recent trends in industry of adopting FSHSCs for IoE applications, several examples of commercialized and demonstrated products, and a detailed discussion of the desirable features and challenges encountered in their deployment in different sectors of the IoE infrastructure. We hope that this will spur new ideas and insights for research into the next generation of IoE devices.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			1754-5692	1754-5706											2022-05-14	WOS:000790385500001

In the present study, a capacitive sensor enhanced by a tilted micropillar array-structured dielectric layer is developed. Because the tilted micropillars undergo bending deformation rather than compression deformation, the distance between the electrodes is easier to change, even discarding the contribution of the air gap at the interface of the structured dielectric layer and the electrode, thus resulting in high pressure sensitivity (0.42 kPa(-1)) and very small detection limit (1 Pa). In addition, eliminating the presence of uncertain air gap, the dielectric layer is strongly bonded with the electrode, which makes the structure robust and endows the sensor with high stability and reliable capacitance response. These characteristics allow the device to remain in normal use without the need for repair or replacement despite mechanical damage. Moreover, the proposed sensor can be tailored to any size and shape, which is further demonstrated in wearable application. This work provides a new strategy for sensors that are required to be sensitive and reliable in actual applications.									200	10	0	0	4	0	203			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-05-15	WOS:000468364500074	31007008

The measurements varied for the same indicator measured by different fitness trackers. The variation in measurement of the number of steps was the highest (Apple Watch 2: 0.42; Dongdong: 0.01), whereas it was the lowest for heart rate (Samsung Gear S3: 0.34; Xiaomi Mi Band 2: 0.12). Measurements differed insignificantly for the same indicator measured under different states of activity; the MAPE of distance and energy measurements were in the range of 0.08 to 0.17 and 0.41 to 0.48, respectively. Overall, the Samsung Gear S3 performed the best for the measurement of heart rate under the resting state (MAPE of 0.04), whereas Dongdong performed the best for the measurement of the number of steps under the walking state (MAPE of 0.01). Fitbit Surge performed the best for distance measurement under the cycling state (MAPE of 0.04), and Huawei Talk Band B3 performed the best for energy consumption measurement under the walking state (MAPE of 0.17).Conclusions: At present, mainstream devices are able to reliably measure heart rate, number of steps, distance, and sleep duration, which can be used as effective health evaluation indicators, but the measurement accuracy of energy consumption is still inadequate. Fitness trackers of different brands vary with regard to measurement of indicators and are all affected by the activity state, which indicates that manufacturers of fitness trackers need to improve their algorithms for different activity states.									161	2	1	0	26	0	165			2291-5222												2018-04-01	WOS:000488245900001	29650506	
J	Schull, Natasha Dow								Data for life: Wearable technology and the design of self-care								BIOSOCIETIES				11	3	SI		317	333				10.1057/biosoc.2015.47							Article	SEP 2016	2016	Over the last 5 years, wearable technology - comprising devices whose embedded sensors and analytic algorithms can track, analyze and guide wearers' behavior - has increasingly captured the attention of venture capitalists, technology startups, established electronics companies and consumers. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted 2 years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call 'data for life', wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.									205	0	1	0	4	0	205			1745-8552	1745-8560											2016-09-01	WOS:000388902500003

Here, we report a flexible sweat analysis patch based on a silk fabric-derived carbon textile for simultaneous detection of six health-related biomarkers. The intrinsically N-doped graphitic structure and the hierarchical woven, porous structure provided the carbon textile good electrical conductivity, rich active sites, and good water wettability for efficient electron transmission and abundant access to reactants, enabling it to serve as an excellent working electrode in electrochemical sensors. On the basis of the above, we fabricated a multiplex sweat analysis patch that is capable of simultaneous detection of glucose, lactate, ascorbic acid, uric acid, Na+, and K+. The integration of selective detectors with signal collection and transmission components in this device has enabled us to realize real-time analysis of sweat.									260	13	0	0	46	0	260			2375-2548												2019-12-10	WOS:000499736100034	31723600

However, the practical application of ZABs is hindered by their low power density and poor rechargeability, which arises from the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on air cathode. Herein, a high-power, wearable ZAB with impressive electrochemical performances is achieved based on a new NiFe nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon nanotubes (NiFe/N-CNT) as bifunctional electrocatalyst. The in-situ Raman and oxygen adsorption and DFT calculations reveal that our designed NiFe/N-CNT catalyst can remarkably promote the oxygen adsorption in ORR and OH- adsorption in OER, which enable this NiFe/N-CNT to own superior electrocatalytic activity toward both OER and ORR. The as-fabricated wearable ZAB with the NiFe/N-CNT as air cathode exhibits an ultrahigh open-circuit potential (Voc) of 1.41 V and a remarkable high peak power density of 105.4 mW cm(-2), Furthermore, it also obtains a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.61 V and superior durability for 800 min. This research provides a new design pathway for the electrocatalysts for high-performance rechargeable and wearable metal-air batteries.									152	16	0	0	7	0	152			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-02-01	WOS:000513811800050

In particular, a wearable and self-powered sensor combining all the merits of sensitivity, transparency, stretchability, and flexibility is highly demanded to adapt human skins. Herein, we report a fully transparent, highly stretchable, and self-powered contact-separation triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a tactile sensor. The TENG consists of a double-network ionogel with the transparency, stretchability, and conductivity as the electrode and one friction layer, and patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as another friction layer. The fabricated sensor reaches a maximum sensitivity of 1.76 V N-1 when detecting impacting forces in the range of 0.1-1 N. Meanwhile, with good stretchability of the sensor, the triboelectric signals maintain a good linearity with impacting forces at different tensile ratios (0%, 10%, 50%, and 80% strain). These properties enable the sensor to be capable of monitoring a variety of human activities, including finger touching and bending, breathing, and pulse beating. We believe such a transparent, stretchable and self-powered tactile TENG sensor has tremendous application potential in wearable and soft electronics.									223	15	0	0	7	0	224			2211-2855	2211-3282											2019-05-01	WOS:000463032200033

Here, this study reports the rational design and fabrication of a novel flexible electrode with nanotube-built multitripod architectures of ternary metal sulfides' composites (FeCo2S4-NiCo2S4) on a silver-sputtered textile cloth. Silver sputtering is applicable to almost all kinds of textiles, and S2- concentration is optimized during sulfidation process to achieve such architectures and also a complete sulfidation assuring high conductivity. New insights into concentration-dependent sulfidation mechanism are proposed. The additive-free FeCo2S4-NiCo2S4 electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 1519 F g(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2) and superior rate capability (85.1% capacitance retention at 40 mA cm(-2)). All-solid-state SCs employing these advanced electrodes deliver high energy density of 46 W h kg(-1) at 1070 W kg(-1) as well as achieve remarkable cycling stability retaining 92% of initial capacitance after 3000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), and outstanding reliability with no capacitance degradation under large twisting. These are attributed to the components' synergy assuring rich redox reactions, high conductivity as well as highly porous but robust architectures. An almost linear increase in capacitance with devices' area indicates possibility to meet various energy output requirements. This work provides a general, low-cost route to wearable power sources.									277	18	0	0	20	0	284			1614-6832	1614-6840											2017-01-01	WOS:000393580900005

Wearable devices, smart-phones and ambient environments devices are equipped with variety of sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometer, heart rate, pressure and wearable camera for activity detection and monitoring. These sensors are pre-processed and different feature sets such as time domain, frequency domain, wavelet transform are extracted and transform using machine learning algorithm for human activity classification and monitoring. Recently, deep learning algorithms for automatic feature representation have also been proposed to lessen the burden of reliance on handcrafted features and to increase performance accuracy. Initially, one set of sensor data, features or classifiers were used for activity recognition applications. However, there are new trends on the implementation of fusion strategies to combine sensors data, features and classifiers to provide diversity, offer higher generalization, and tackle challenging issues. For instances, combination of inertial sensors provide mechanism to differentiate activity of similar patterns and accurate posture identification while other multimodal sensor data are used for energy expenditure estimations, object localizations in smart homes and health status monitoring. Hence, the focus of this review is to provide in-depth and comprehensive analysis of data fusion and multiple classifier systems techniques for human activity recognition with emphasis on mobile and wearable devices. First, data fusion methods and modalities were presented and also feature fusion, including deep learning fusion for human activity recognition were critically analysed, and their applications, strengths and issues were identified. Furthermore, the review presents different multiple classifier system design and fusion methods that were recently proposed in literature. Finally, open research problems that require further research and improvements are identified and discussed.									174	2	0	0	7	1	177			1566-2535	1872-6305											2018-12-28	WOS:000449448400014

Progress in materials and devices and key perspectives in this field are outlined.Electrochemical capacitors can store electrical energy harvested from intermittent sources and deliver energy quickly, but their energy density must be increased if they are to efficiently power flexible and wearable electronics, as well as larger equipment. This Review summarizes progress in the field of materials for electrochemical capacitors over the past decade as well as outlines key perspectives for future research. We describe electrical double-layer capacitors based on high-surface-area carbons, pseudocapacitive materials such as oxides and the two-dimensional inorganic compounds known as MXenes, and emerging microdevices for the Internet of Things.

In this work, we report a bionic stretchable nanogenerator for underwater energy harvesting that mimics the structure of ion channels on the cytomembrane of electrocyte in an electric eel. Combining the effects of triboelectrification caused by flowing liquid and principles of electrostatic induction, the bionic stretchable nanogenerator can harvest mechanical energy from human motion underwater and output an open-circuit voltage over 10 V. Underwater applications of a bionic stretchable nanogenerator have also been demonstrated, such as human body multi-position motion monitoring and an undersea rescue system. The advantages of excellent flexibility, stretchability, outstanding tensile fatigue resistance (over 50,000 times) and underwater performance make the bionic stretchable nanogenerator a promising sustainable power source for the soft wearable electronics used underwater.									296	26	0	0	22	0	302			2041-1723												2019-07-01	WOS:000472032300010	31217422

However, profound challenges remain in developing ionic devices that retain their properties in extreme environmental conditions, such as subzero temperatures. Based on a zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (PIL), an anti-freezing hydrogel was designed and synthesized for use in a multimodal artificial skin. This zwitterionic PIL hydrogel exhibited super-stretchability (approximately 900%), self-healing ability, and high conductivity (-1.1 S m(-1)), even at low temperature (-20 degrees C). Based on this zwitterionic PIL hydrogel, three sensing modes, capacitive, resistive, and triboelectric modes, can be achieved in one device, which is stable under a wide temperature range (-20 degrees C to 60 degrees C). Further applications of these multimodal sensors with a soft robotic gripper suggested a new approach for developing sophisticated stimuli-responsive skin with multifunctionality and adaptability to varied environmental conditions.									217	15	0	0	22	0	224			2051-6347	2051-6355											2020-03-01	WOS:000519943400018

In this paper, we reported for the first time a room temperature Au-MoSe2 composite ammonia (NH3) sensor driven by a novel flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor MoS2 flake. Moreover, we also demonstrated the MoS2-based PENG device attached to the human body for harvesting diverse body motion energy, demonstrating its strong potential for applications in wearable devices. A series of characterizations of 2D piezoelectric semiconductor MoS2 and Au-MoSe2 sensing materials were carried out. The Au-MoSe2 composite-based ammonia sensor with MoS2 PENG showed a higher response (V-a/V-g = 29 @ 100 ppm NH3) toward NH3 than that of MoSe2 counterpart (V-a/V-g = 25 @ 100 ppm NH3). And it has superior selectivity and outstanding long-term stability. Moreover, the sensor also has a fast response/recovery time (18 s/16 s) towards 20 ppm NH3. Finally, the enhanced sensing mechanism of Au-MoSe2 composite toward NH3 was discussed by using first-principle calculations based on density functional theory.									210	10	0	0	7	0	210			2211-2855	2211-3282											2019-11-28	WOS:000496445600033

Due to the miniature size and ability of wireless data transfer, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have become the center of attention in current medical media technologies. For a long-term and reliable healthcare system, high energy efficiency, transmission reliability, and longer battery lifetime of wearable sensors devices are required. There is a dire need for empowering sensor-based wearable techniques in BSNs from every aspect i.e., data collection, healthcare monitoring, and diagnosis. The consideration of protocol layers, data routing, and energy optimization strategies improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Hence, this work presents some key contributions. Firstly, it proposes a novel avant-garde framework to simultaneously optimize the energy efficiency, battery lifetime, and reliability for smart and connected healthcare. Secondly, in this study, an Adaptive Transmission Data Rate (ATDR) mechanism is proposed, which works on the average constant energy consumption by varying the active time of the sensor node to optimize the energy over the dynamic wireless channel. Moreover, a Self-Adaptive Routing Algorithm (SARA) is developed to adopt a dynamic source routing mechanism with an energy-efficient and shortest possible path, unlike the conventional routing methods. Lastly, real-time datasets are adopted for intensive experimental setup for revealing pervasive and cost-effective healthcare through wearable devices. It is observed and analysed that proposed algorithms outperform in terms of high energy efficiency, better reliability, and longer battery lifetime of portable devices.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1547-1063	1551-0018											2022-03-04	WOS:000755775400001	35341282

Here, a low-cost fabrication strategy to efficiently construct highly sensitive graphite-based strain sensors by pencil-trace drawn on flexible printing papers is reported. The strain sensors can be operated at only two batteries voltage of 3 V, and can be applied to variously monitoring microstructural changes and human motions with fast response/relaxation times of 110 ms, a high gauge factor (GF) of 536.6, and high stability > 10 000 bending-unbending cycles. Through investigation of service behaviors of the sensors, it is found that the microcracks occur on the surface of the pencil-trace and have a major influence on the functions of the strain sensors. These performances of the strain sensor attain and even surpass the properties of recent strain sensing devices with subtle design of materials and device architectures. The pen-on-paper (PoP) approach may further develop portable, environmentally friendly, and economical lab-on-paper applications and offer a valuable method to fabricate other multifunctional devices.									397	20	0	0	19	0	403			1616-301X	1616-3028											2015-04-22	WOS:000353572600005

Here, we show that data from consumer smartwatches can be used for the pre-symptomatic detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analysed physiological and activity data from 32 individuals infected with COVID-19, identified from a cohort of nearly 5,300 participants, and found that 26 of them (81%) had alterations in their heart rate, number of daily steps or time asleep. Of the 25 cases of COVID-19 with detected physiological alterations for which we had symptom information, 22 were detected before (or at) symptom onset, with four cases detected at least nine days earlier. Using retrospective smartwatch data, we show that 63% of the COVID-19 cases could have been detected before symptom onset in real time via a two-tiered warning system based on the occurrence of extreme elevations in resting heart rate relative to the individual baseline. Our findings suggest that activity tracking and health monitoring via consumer wearable devices may be used for the large-scale, real-time detection of respiratory infections, often pre-symptomatically.									153	3	0	0	40	0	156			2157-846X												2020-11-18	WOS:000590951400001	33208926

Based on the multiple weak H-bonds and synergistic effects between the three components, the as-prepared hybrid hydrogel exhibits ultrastretchability with high elasticity, good self healing, excellent conformability, and high self-adhesiveness to diverse substrates both in air and underwater. More importantly, the ternary hydrogel exhibits high strain sensitivity especially under subtle strains with a gauge factor of 2.0, which is close to the theoretical value of the ionic hydrogel sensors; an extremely large workable range of strain (0.05-2100%); and a low operating voltage 0.07 V. Consequently, the sensor demonstrates superior sensing performance for real-time monitoring of the large and subtle human motions, including limb motions, swallowing, smiling, and wrist pulse. Therefore, it is believed that the STP hydrogel has great potential applications in health monitoring, smart wearable devices, and soft robots.									219	8	0	0	38	0	222			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-03-19	WOS:000460365300013	30699289

Consequently, textile DSSCs are being looked at for their sustainability, flexibility, pliability, and lightweight properties, as well as the possibility of using large-scale industrial manufacturing methods (e.g., weaving and screen printing). These are important features in fabricating not only wearable electronic devices, but also for the large-scale harnessing of solar power from canopies, sunshades, greenhouses, covers, and other applications. Textile DSSCs are mainly of two types, i.e., yarn-type and planar-type. Electrodes in the shape of yarn or wires can be produced by coating and depositing active material onto polymeric or metallic fibers, yarns, or wires. By intertwining or twisting two yarns, namely the photo-electrode (PE) and counter-electrode (CE), a yarn-type DSSC can be formed. Instead, planar-type DSSCs can be produced by interlacing photovoltaic yarns through standard textile manufacturing processes. Alternatively, planar-type DSSCs can be produced by applying conducting layers to the planar textile structure. This review presents a concise summary of various textile structures, materials, fabrication methods, and factors affecting the performance of these two types of textile DSSCs. This also provides the challenges and limitations of each method, thus highlighting areas for potential future work.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			0947-7047	1862-0760											2022-05-21	WOS:000789816200002

Here, the authors report a highly integrated ring consisting of multimodal sensing and feedback units for augmented interactions in metaverse.Advancements of virtual reality technology pave the way for developing wearable devices to enable somatosensory sensation, which can bring more comprehensive perception and feedback in the metaverse-based virtual society. Here, we propose augmented tactile-perception and haptic-feedback rings with multimodal sensing and feedback capabilities. This highly integrated ring consists of triboelectric and pyroelectric sensors for tactile and temperature perception, and vibrators and nichrome heaters for vibro- and thermo-haptic feedback. All these components integrated on the ring can be directly driven by a custom wireless platform of low power consumption for wearable/portable scenarios. With voltage integration processing, high-resolution continuous finger motion tracking is achieved via the triboelectric tactile sensor, which also contributes to superior performance in gesture/object recognition with artificial intelligence analysis. By fusing the multimodal sensing and feedback functions, an interactive metaverse platform with cross-space perception capability is successfully achieved, giving people a face-to-face like immersive virtual social experience.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38				2041-1723											2022-09-11	WOS:000850348400009	36064838

In this work, promising flexible Cu2Se based thin films with high thermoelectric performance is successfully fabricated via a facile co-sputtering method. Experimental results indicate that excess Cu in Cu2Se films leads to the decrease of carrier concentration by suppressing the formation of Cu vacancies and donating electrons, benefiting to achieve high Seebeck coefficient. Moreover, Cu-excess Cu2Se films have highly (0l0) preferred orientation and extra high carrier mobility, maintaining the decent electrical conductivity in the whole measurement temperature range. Combined with the low thermal conductivity, a maximum ZT of 0.42 is obtained at 275 degrees C from the Cu-excess Cu2Se due to the simultaneous optimization both of electrical and heat transport. Subsequently, a flexible thermoelectric device assembled with high performance Cu2Se films exhibits a maximum power density of 4.28 Wm(-2) at a temperature difference of 50 degrees C, which thermal stability is greatly improved after introducing a molybdenum buffer layer into electrode layer. Therefore, this work demonstrates that rational microstructure manipulations and connection technology improvement can achieve high performance in the flexible thermoelectric device, which possess potential in wearable applications.

However, such instruments tend to be expensive and require expert operation and maintenance besides their high cost, thus limiting them to only a small number of specialized centers. Consequently, gait analysis in most clinics today still relies on observation-based assessment. Recent advances in wearable sensors, especially inertial body sensors, have opened up a promising future for gait analysis. Not only can these sensors be more easily adopted in clinical diagnosis and treatment procedures than their current counterparts, but they can also monitor gait continuously outside clinics - hence providing seamless patient analysis from clinics to free-living environments. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of current techniques for quantitative gait analysis and to propose key metrics for evaluating both existing and emerging methods for qualifying the gait features extracted from wearable sensors. It aims to highlight key advances in this rapidly evolving research field and outline potential future directions for both research and clinical applications.									211	3	0	0	35	1	215			2168-2194	2168-2208											2016-11-01	WOS:000389846700008	28113185

Herein, flexible, strong, and self-cleaning graphene-aerogel composite fibers, with tunable functions of thermal conversion and storage under multistimuli, are fabricated. The fibers made from porous graphene aerogel/organic phase-change materials coated with hydrophobic fluorocarbon resin render a wide range of phase transition temperature and enthalpy (0-186 J g(-1)).

The goal in most cases is to obtain measurements that serve as surrogates for circulating analyte concentrations in blood. Key technological developments to date include continuous glucose monitors, which use an indwelling sensor needle to measure glucose in interstitial fluid, and device-integrated sweat stimulation for continuous access to analytes in sweat. Further development of continuous sensing technologies through new electrochemical sensing modalities will be a major focus of future research. While there has been much investment in wearable technologies to sense analytes, less effort has been directed to understanding the physiology of biofluid secretion. Elucidating the underlying biology is crucial for accelerating technological progress, as the biofluid itself often presents the greatest challenge in terms of sample volumes, secretion rates, filtration, active analyte channels, variable pH and salinity, analyte breakdown and other confounding factors.									253	12	0	0	75	0	259			1087-0156	1546-1696											2019-04-01	WOS:000463006000021	30804536

Herein, knittable fiber-shaped zinc-air batteries with high volumetric energy density (36.1 mWh cm(-3)) are fabricated via a facile and continuous method with low-cost materials. Furthermore, a high-yield method is developed to prepare the key component of the fiber-shaped zinc-air battery, i.e., a bifunctional catalyst composed of atomically thin layer-by-layer mesoporous Co3O4/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) nanosheets. Benefiting from the high surface area, mesoporous structure, and strong synergetic effect between the Co3O4 and N-rGO nanosheets, the bifunctional catalyst exhibits high activity and superior durability for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Compared to a fiber-shaped zinc-air battery using state-of-the-art Pt/C + RuO2 catalysts, the battery based on these Co3O4/N-rGO nanosheets demonstrates enhanced and stable electrochemical performance, even under severe deformation. Such batteries, for the first time, can be successfully knitted into clothes without short circuits under external forces and can power various electronic devices and even charge a cellphone.									278	21	0	0	8	0	280			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-01-25	WOS:000422932800007	29210114

In this work, all-hydrogel soft supercapacitors consisting of reversibly deformable hydrogel electrodes and electrolyte are constructed without using additional stretchable substrate or separator membrane. Both electrode and electrolyte contain the same polyacrylamide/sodium alginate dual-network hydrogel matrix, making them possess superb self-adhesion due to hydrophilic interaction/hydrogen bonds, and highly softness/toughness thanks to the energy-dissipative mechanism. After adding carbon nanotube conductive network/electrode active material and electrolyte salt/redox couple in the hydrogel matrix, the newly developed supercapacitor with all-in-one architecture is intrinsically highly stretchable/compressible and can even be deformed arbitrarily under various severe stress-strain deformation conditions at device level, simultaneously deliver high areal capacitance (232 mF cm(-2) at 5 mV s(-1) and 128 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2)) and maintain stable energy output.

It has gained much attraction in various smart home environments, especially to continuously monitor human behaviors in ambient assisted living to provide elderly care and rehabilitation. The system follows various operation modules such as data acquisition, pre-processing to eliminate noise and distortions, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. Recently, various state-of-the-art techniques have proposed feature extraction and selection techniques classified using traditional Machine learning classifiers. However, most of the techniques use rustic feature extraction processes that are incapable of recognizing complex activities. With the emergence and advancement of high computational resources, Deep Learning techniques are widely used in various HAR systems to retrieve features and classification efficiently. Thus, this review paper focuses on providing profound concise of deep learning techniques used in smartphone and wearable sensor-based recognition systems. The proposed techniques are categorized into conventional and hybrid deep learning models described with its uniqueness, merits, and limitations. The paper also discusses various benchmark datasets used in existing techniques. Finally, the paper lists certain challenges and issues that require future research and improvements.									64	0	0	0	2	0	64			1530-437X	1558-1748											2021-06-15	WOS:000664030600004

However, previously reported contact lens sensors can only monitor a single analyte at a time. Furthermore, such ocular contact lenses generally obstruct the field of vision of the subject. Here, we developed a multifunctional contact lens sensor that alleviates some of these limitations since it was developed on an actual ocular contact lens. It was also designed to monitor glucose within tears, as well as intraocular pressure using the resistance and capacitance of the electronic device. Furthermore, in-vivo and in-vitro tests using a live rabbit and bovine eyeball demonstrated its reliable operation. Our developed contact lens sensor can measure the glucose level in tear fluid and intraocular pressure simultaneously but yet independently based on different electrical responses.									443	18	0	0	76	0	453			2041-1723												2017-05-17	WOS:000400154000001	28447604

Due to the high filler concentration required, formulation of such waste-free inks has proven quite challenging. Here, additive-free, 2D titanium carbide MXene aqueous inks with appropriate rheological properties for scalable screen printing are demonstrated. Importantly, the inks consist essentially of the sediments of unetched precursor and multilayered MXene, which are usually discarded after delamination. Screen-printed structures are presented on paper with high resolution and spatial uniformity, including micro-supercapacitors, conductive tracks, integrated circuit paths, and others. It is revealed that the delaminated nanosheets among the layered particles function as efficient conductive binders, maintaining the mechanical integrity and thus the metallic conductive network. The areal capacitance (158 mF cm(-2)) and energy density (1.64 mu Wh cm(-2)) of the printed micro-supercapacitors are much superior to other devices based on MXene or graphene. The ink formulation strategy of "turning trash into treasure" for screen printing highlights the potential of waste-free MXene sediment printing for scalable and sustainable production of next-generation wearable smart electronics.									172	16	0	0	7	0	173			0935-9648	1521-4095											2020-03-20	WOS:000520759100001	32196130

Many of these physiological parameters, such as Heart rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR), are extracted indirectly and using other signals such as Photoplethysmograph (PPG). Part of the reason is that in some cases, such as RR measurements, the devices which directly measure them are cumbersome to wear and thus, rather impractical. On the other hand, signals, such as PPG from which the RR can be extracted, are not very clean. This poses a challenge on reliable extraction of these metrics. The most important problem is that they are corrupted by motion artifacts. In this paper, we review the state of the art algorithms which are used to detect and filter motion artifacts in PPG signals and compare them in terms of their performance. The insight provided by this paper can help the scientists and engineers to obtain a better understanding of the field and be able to use the most suitable technique for their work, or come up with innovative solutions based on existing ones.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			1383-469X	1572-8153											2022-06-26	WOS:000812275700026

Here we report the design and performance of a wearable electrochemical biosensor for the continuous analysis, in sweat during physical exercise and at rest, of trace levels of multiple metabolites and nutrients, including all essential amino acids and vitamins. The biosensor consists of graphene electrodes that can be repeatedly regenerated in situ, functionalized with metabolite-specific antibody-like molecularly imprinted polymers and redox-active reporter nanoparticles, and integrated with modules for iontophoresis-based sweat induction, microfluidic sweat sampling, signal processing and calibration, and wireless communication. In volunteers, the biosensor enabled the real-time monitoring of the intake of amino acids and their levels during physical exercise, as well as the assessment of the risk of metabolic syndrome (by correlating amino acid levels in serum and sweat).

However, it is still a challenge for hydrogel-based wearable devices to be integrated with high conductivity, a self-healing ability, remoldability, self-adhesiveness, good mechanical strength and high stretchability, good biocompatibility, and stimulus-responsiveness. Herein, multi-functional conductive composite hydrogels were fabricated by a simple one-pot method based on poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), sodium alginate (SA), and tannic acid (TA) using borax as a cross-linker. The composite hydrogel network was built by borate ester bonds and hydrogen bonds. The obtained hydrogel exhibited pH- and sugar-responsiveness, high stretchability (780% strain), and fast self-healing performance with healing efficiency (HE) as high as 93.56% without any external stimulus. Additionally, the hydrogel displayed considerable conductive behavior and stable changes of resistance with high sensitivity (gauge factor (GF) = 15.98 at a strain of 780%). The hydrogel was further applied as a strain sensor for monitoring large and tiny human motions with durable stability. Significantly, the healed hydrogel also showed good sensing behavior. This work broadens the avenue for the design and preparation of biocompatible polymer-based hydrogels to promote the application of hydrogel sensors with comfortable wearing feel and high sensitivity.									129	4	0	0	16	1	131			1944-8244	1944-8252											2021-02-23	WOS:000629054100064	33620195

Natural/artificial fiber textiles are regarded as prospective materials for flexible ASCs due to their outstanding physicochemical properties. Here, a high-performance ASC is designed by employing graphene-encapsulated polyester fiber loaded with polyaniline as the flexible electrodes and bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofiber-reinforced polyacrylamide as the hydrogel electrolyte. The ASC combines the textile electrode capable of arbitrary deformation with the BC-reinforced hydrogel with high ionic conductivity (125 mS cm(-1)), high tensile strength (330 kPa), and superelasticity (stretchability up to approximate to 1300%), giving rise to a device with high stability/compatibility between the electrodes and electrolyte that is compliant with flexible electronics. As a result, this ASC delivers high areal capacitance of 564 mF cm(-2), excellent rate capability, good energy/power densities, and more importantly, superior mechanical properties without significant capacitance degradation after repeated bending, confirming the functionality of the ASC under mechanical deformation. This work demonstrates an effective design for a sufficiently tough energy storage device, which shows great potential in truly wearable applications.									85	5	0	0	5	0	87			1614-6832	1614-6840											2021-03-02	WOS:000616474700001

Because the surface area of a human body is limited to 2 m(2), the key challenge in this field is how to realize a high areal capacitance for SCs, while achieving rapid charging, good capacitive retention, flexibility, and waterproofing. To address this challenge, low-cost materials are used including multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and metallic textiles to fabricate composite fabric electrodes, in which MWCNT and RGO are alternatively vacuum-filtrated directly onto Ni-coated cotton fabrics. The composite fabric electrodes display typical electrical double layer capacitor behavior, and reach an ultrahigh areal capacitance up to 6.2 F cm(-2) at a high areal current density of 20 mA cm(-2). All-solid-state fabric-type SC devices made with the composite fabric electrodes and water-repellent treatment can reach record-breaking performance of 2.7 F cm(-2) at 20 mA cm(-2) at the first charge-discharge cycle, 3.2 F cm(-2) after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles, zero capacitive decay after 10 000 bending tests, and 10 h continuous underwater operation. The SC devices are easy to assemble into tandem structures and integrate into garments by simple sewing.									329	25	0	0	18	0	339			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-05-17	WOS:000401170600026	28234421

From the as-prepared flexible sensor, tunable sensitivity (0.042 to 0.152 kPa(-1)), wide working range (0-27 kPa), fast response (approximate to 96 ms), high current output (approximate to 300 A at 1 V), frequency-dependent performance reliable repeatability (approximate to 9000 cycle) and stable signal waveform output can be readily obtained. In addition to tiny physiological activities (voice recognition, swallowing, mouth opening, blowing and breath), robust human motions (finger bending, elbow movement and knee squatting-arising) can also be detected in real-time by the flexible sensors based on rGO/polyaniline wrapped sponge. All the results demonstrate that the flexible pressure sensor based on the functional-sponge is a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable circuitry in artificial intelligence.									197	14	0	0	16	0	199			2040-3364	2040-3372											2018-06-07	WOS:000434313200025	29774921

Solution processing of graphite and other layered materials provides low-cost inks enabling printed electronic devices, for example by inkjet printing. However, the limited quality of the 2D-material inks, the complexity of the layered arrangement, and the lack of a dielectric 2D-material ink able to operate at room temperature, under strain and after several washing cycles has impeded the fabrication of electronic devices on textile with fully printed 2D heterostructures. Here we demonstrate fully inkjet-printed 2D-material active heterostructures with graphene and hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) inks, and use them to fabricate all inkjet-printed flexible and washable field-effect transistors on textile, reaching a field-effect mobility of similar to 91 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), at low voltage (< 5 V). This enables fully inkjet-printed electronic circuits, such as reprogrammable volatile memory cells, complementary inverters and OR logic gates.									265	11	0	0	11	0	268			2041-1723												2017-10-31	WOS:000414032200005	29089495

The recent sensor fabrication progress is respectable, but it is limited by complexity, low sensitivity and unideal service life. Herein a facile, cost-effective and scalable method is presented for the development of high-performance strain sensors and stretchable conductors based on a composite film consisting of graphene platelets (GnPs) and silicon rubber. Through calculation by the tunneling theory using experimental data, the composite film has demonstrated ideal linear and reproducible sensitivity to tensile strains, which is contributed by the superior piezoresistivity of GnPs having tunable gauge factors 27.7-164.5. The composite sensors fabricated in different days demonstrate pretty similar performance, enabling applications as a health-monitoring device to detect various human motions from finger bending to pulse. They can be used as electronic skin, a vibration sensor and a human-machine interface controller. Stretchable conductors are made by coating and encapsulating GnPs with polydimethyl siloxane to create another composite; this structure allows the conductor to be readily bent and stretched with sufficient mechanical robustness and cyclability.									301	15	0	0	22	0	307			1616-301X	1616-3028											2016-11-08	WOS:000388166700008

However, it remains a big challenge to fully satisfy the aforementioned requirements. In particular, there is always a trade-off between high sensitivity and wide sensing range. Here, we developed a multifunctional strain sensor based on a network-structured MXene/polyurethane mat (network-M/P mat) and well balanced the relationship between the sensitivity and sensing range by rationally designing the morphology and microstructures of the sensing device. The network-structured polyurethane mat (network-P mat) was fabricated through a facile and scalable electrospinning technique. The highly conductive MXene sheets were decorated onto the network-P mat through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions. The obtained highly flexible and stretchable network-M/P mat exhibited a superior comprehensive sensing performance that was characterized by high sensitivity (gauge factor up to 228), a low limit of detection (0.1%), a large and tunable sensing range (up to 150%), excellent stability (over 3200 cycles), and multiple functions (lateral strain, vertical pressure, bending and subtle vibration). Based on its superior performance, the network-M/P mat-based strain sensor can detect a full range of body actions and subtle physiological signals (e.g. respirations and pulse waves), demonstrating great potential for applications in artificial electronic skin and wearable health detectors.									111	9	0	0	7	0	114			2040-3364	2040-3372											2019-06-14	WOS:000469246100013	31070651

Detection of acetone in human respiration offers an effective and painless approach for the diagnosis of prediabetes. In this work, a wearable active acetone biosensor employing chitosan and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as sensitive materials was developed to non-invasively diagnose prediabetes. When operated under 97.3% relative humidity at room temperature, the prepared chitosan and RGO composite film-based sensor exhibited a good sensing response of 27.89% under 10 ppm acetone in respiratory gases, which is about 5 times higher than the sensing response of pure chitosan film-based devices. In addition, finite element analysis and phase-field simulation were conducted to provide theoretical support for the active sensing mechanism. This work not only presents a wirelessly powered wearable active acetone biosensor, but also paves the way for a new method of non-invasive prediabetes diagnosis.									156	7	0	0	16	0	156			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-07-21	WOS:000546641600005

Because electrode materials are the core component of flexible solid-state supercapacitors, we exhaustively review the recent investigations involving electrode materials that have used carbons, metal oxides, and conductive polymers. The principles and methods of optimizing and fabricating electrodes for use in flexible supercapacitors are discussed through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. In addition, we focused on three types of flexible solid-state supercapacitors (fiber-, paper-, and porous foam-based structures) to satisfy the requirements of flexible electronic devices. Further, we summarize the practical applications of flexible solid-state supercapacitors, including energy conversion/collection devices and energy storage/detection devices. Finally, we provide the developmental direction for flexible solid-state supercapacitors in the future.									113	2	0	0	5	0	113			2040-3364	2040-3372											2019-05-08	WOS:000465315900002	30931460

This article provides a theoretical reflection on the phenomenon of embodiment relation in technological mediation and then assesses the embodiment of wearable augmented reality technology in a tourism attraction. The findings suggest that technology embodiment is a multidimensional construct consisting of ownership, location, and agency. These support the concept of technology withdrawal, where technology disappears as it becomes part of human actions, and contest the interplay of subjectivity and intentionality between humans and technology in situated experiences such as tourism. It was also found that technology embodiment affects enjoyment and enhances experience with tourism attractions.									121	1	0	0	1	1	124			0047-2875	1552-6763											2018-04-27	WOS:000430023900003

Compared to flexible sensors based on filler/elastomer composites, conductive hydrogels are advantageous due to their biomimetic structures and properties, as well as biocompatibility. Numerous chemical and structural designs provide unlimited opportunities to tune the properties and performance of conductive hydrogels to match various demands for practical applications. Many electronically and ionically conductive hydrogels have been developed to fabricate pressure and strain sensors with different configurations, including resistance type and capacitance type. The sensitivity, reliability and stability of hydrogel sensors are dependent on their network structures and mechanical properties. This review focuses on tough conductive hydrogels for flexible sensors. Representative strategies to prepare stretchable, strong, tough and self-healing hydrogels are briefly reviewed since these strategies are illuminating for the development of tough conductive hydrogels. Then, a general account on various conductive hydrogels is presented and discussed. Recent advances in tough conductive hydrogels with well designed network structures and their sensory performance are discussed in detail. A series of conductive hydrogel sensors and their application in wearable devices are reviewed. Some perspectives on flexible conductive hydrogel sensors and their applications are presented at the end.									267	7	0	0	36	0	268			2050-750X	2050-7518											2020-04-28	WOS:000548186500016	32100788

However, due to the trade-off between sensitivity and linear detection range, obtaining piezoresistive sensors with both a wide pressure monitoring range and a high sensitivity is still a great challenge. Herein, we design a hierarchically microstructure-bioinspired flexible piezoresistive sensor consisting of a hierarchical polyaniline/polyvinylidene fluoride nanofiber (HPPNF) film sandwiched between two interlocking electrodes with microdome structure. Ascribed to the substantially enlarged 3D deformation rates, these bioelectronics exhibit an ultrahigh sensitivity of 53 kPa(-1), a pressure detection range from 58.4 to 960 Pa, a fast response time of 38 ms, and excellent cycle stability over 50 000 cycles. Furthermore, this conformally skin-adhered sensor successfully demonstrates the monitoring of human physiological signals and movement states, such as wrist pulse, throat activity, spinal posture, and gait recognition. Evidently, this hierarchically microstructure-bioinspired and amplified sensitivity piezoresistive sensor provides a promising strategy for the rapid development of next-generation wearable bioelectronics.									99	4	0	0	12	0	99			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-06-15	WOS:000679406500051	34128640

Here, we observed a giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft system based on micromagnets dispersed in a silicone matrix, reaching a magnetomechanical coupling factor indicating up to four times more enhancement than in rigid counterparts. The results are interpreted using a wavy chain model, showing how mechanical stress changes the micromagnets' spacing and dipole alignment, thus altering the magnetic field generated by the composite. Combined with liquid-metal coils patterned on polydimethylsiloxane working as a magnetic induction layer, the soft magnetoelastic composite is used for stretchable and water-resistant magnetoelastic generators adhering conformably to human skin. Such devices can be used as wearable or implantable power generators and biomedical sensors, opening alternative avenues for human-body-centred applications.									99	2	0	0	11	0	100			1476-1122	1476-4660											2021-10-07	WOS:000702259100001	34594013

However, their high toxicity and moisture sensitivity impede their practical applications. Herein, a stretchable, breathable, and stable nanofiber composite (LPPS-NFC) is fabricated through electrospinning of lead-free perovskite/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS). The Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskites serve as efficient electron acceptors and local nucleating agents for the crystallization of polymer chains, thereby enhancing the electron-trapping capacity and polar crystalline phase in LPPS-NFC. The excellent energy level matching between Cs3Bi2Br9 and PVDF-HFP boosts the electron transfer efficiency and reduces the charge loss, thereby promoting the electron-trapping process. Consequently, this LPPS-NFC-based energy harvester displays an excellent electrical output (400 V, 1.63 mu A cm(-2), and 2.34 W m(-2)), setting a record of the output voltage among halide-perovskite-based nanogenerators. The LPPS-NFC also exhibits excellent stretchability, waterproofness, and breathability, enabling the fabrication of robust wearable devices that convert mechanical energy from different biomechanical motions into electrical power to drive common electronic devices. The LPPS-NFC-based energy harvesters also endure extreme mechanical deformations (washing, folding, and crumpling) without performance degradation, and maintain stable electrical output up to 5 months, demonstrating their promising potential for use as smart textiles and wearable power sources.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-03-31	WOS:000770842200001	35231951

In this study, we review the state-of-the-art advancements in FSSCs to provide new insights on mechanisms, emerging electrode materials, flexible gel electrolytes and novel cell designs. The review begins with a brief introduction on the fundamental understanding of charge storage mechanisms based on the structural properties of electrode materials. The next sections briefly summarise the latest progress in flexible electrodes (i.e., freestanding and substrate-supported, including textile, paper, metal foil/wire and polymer-based substrates) and flexible gel electrolytes (i.e., aqueous, organic, ionic liquids and redox-active gels). Subsequently, a comprehensive summary of FSSC cell designs introduces some emerging electrode materials, including MXenes, metal nitrides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), polyoxometalates (POMs) and black phosphorus.

However, flexible lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are vastly limited by their intrinsic safety and cost issues. Here we introduce an extremely safe and wearable solid-state zinc ion battery (ZIB) comprising a novel gelatin and PAM based hierarchical polymer electrolyte (HPE) and an alpha-MnO2 nanorod/carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode. Benefiting from the well-designed electrolyte and electrodes, the flexible solid-state ZIB delivers a high areal energy density and power density (6.18 mW h cm(-2) and 148.2 mW cm(-2), respectively), high specific capacity (306 mA h g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (97% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2772 mA g(-1)). More importantly, the solid-state ZIB offers a high wearability and an extreme safety performance over conventional flexible LIBs, and performs very well under various severe conditions, such as being greatly cut, bent, hammered, punctured, sewed, washed in water or even put on fire. In addition, flexible ZIBs were integrated in series to power a commercial smart watch, a wearable pulse sensor, and a smart insole, which has been achieved to the best of our knowledge for the first time. These results demonstrate the promising potential of ZIBs in many practical wearable applications and offer a new platform for flexible and wearable energy storage technologies.									601	54	0	0	17	0	615			1754-5692	1754-5706											2018-04-01	WOS:000430537000019

Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.									1460	21	1	1	52	1	1496				1553-877X											2013-01-01	WOS:000322728300012

Over the last decades, printing methods including inkjet printing, template-assisted printing, and 3D printing are extensively investigated and utilized in fabricating intelligent micro/nano devices, as printing strategies allow for constructing multidimensional and multimaterial architectures. Great strides in printable smart materials are opening new possibilities for functional devices to better serve human beings, such as wearable sensors, integrated optoelectronics, artificial neurons, and so on. However, there are still many challenges and drawbacks that need to be overcome in order to achieve the controllable modulation between smart materials and device performance. In this review, we give an overview on printable smart materials, printing strategies, and applications of printed functional devices. In addition, the advantages in actual practices of printing smart materials-based devices are discussed, and the current limitations and future opportunities are proposed. This review aims to summarize the recent progress and provide reference for novel smart materials and printing strategies as well as applications of intelligent devices.									58	5	0	0	2	0	58			0009-2665	1520-6890											2022-05-08	WOS:000781212200007	34415152

The technology and products related to fall detection have always been in high demand within the security and the health-care industries. An effective fall detection system is required to provide urgent support and to significantly reduce the medical care costs associated with falls. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of different systems for fall detection and their underlying algorithms. Fall detection approaches are divided into three main categories: wearable device based, ambience device based and vision based. These approaches are summarised and compared with each other and a conclusion is derived with some discussions on possible future work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To address these unmet healthcare needs, especially for the early prediction and treatment of major diseases, health informatics, which deals with the acquisition, transmission, processing, storage, retrieval, and use of health information, has emerged as an active area of interdisciplinary research. In particular, acquisition of health-related information by unobtrusive sensing and wearable technologies is considered as a cornerstone in health informatics. Sensors can be weaved or integrated into clothing, accessories, and the living environment, such that health information can be acquired seamlessly and pervasively in daily living. Sensors can even be designed as stick-on electronic tattoos or directly printed onto human skin to enable long-term health monitoring. This paper aims to provide an overview of four emerging unobtrusive and wearable technologies, which are essential to the realization of pervasive health information acquisition, including: 1) unobtrusive sensing methods, 2) smart textile technology, 3) flexible-stretchable-printable electronics, and 4) sensor fusion, and then to identify some future directions of research.									467	11	1	0	54	0	482			0018-9294	1558-2531											2014-05-01	WOS:000335150300017	24759283

However, current sensors cannot accurately detect low analyte concentrations, lack multimodal sensing or are difficult to fabricate at large scale. We report an entirely laser-engraved sensor for simultaneous sweat sampling, chemical sensing and vital-sign monitoring. We demonstrate continuous detection of temperature, respiration rate and low concentrations of uric acid and tyrosine, analytes associated with diseases such as gout and metabolic disorders. We test the performance of the device in both physically trained and untrained subjects under exercise and after a protein-rich diet. We also evaluate its utility for gout monitoring in patients and healthy controls through a purine-rich meal challenge. Levels of uric acid in sweat were higher in patients with gout than in healthy individuals, and a similar trend was observed in serum.									469	18	0	0	80	0	472			1087-0156	1546-1696											2020-02-01	WOS:000511666100025	31768044

However, most stretchable humidity sensors are based on the geometric engineering of non-stretchable components and only a few detailed studies are available on stretchable humidity sensors under applied mechanical deformations. In this paper, we propose a transparent, stretchable humidity sensor with a simple fabrication process, having intrinsically stretchable components that provide high stretchability, sensitivity, and stability along with fast response and relaxation time. Composed of reduced graphene oxide-polyurethane composites and an elastomeric conductive electrode, this device exhibits impressive response and relaxation time as fast as 3.5 and 7 s, respectively. The responsivity and the response and relaxation time of the device in the presence of humidity remain almost unchanged under stretching up to a strain of 60% and after 10,000 stretching cycles at a 40% strain. Further, these stretchable humidity sensors can be easily and conformally attached to a finger for monitoring the humidity levels of the environment around the human body, wet objects, or human skin.									169	9	0	0	9	0	170			1998-0124	1998-0000											2017-06-01	WOS:000401320700017

However, the traditional conductive gel needs to be attached to the application surface with external force, and only respond to the single strain stimulus. Moreover, due to the existence of water, ordinary hydrogels cannot work at below zero temperatures, which severely limits the application of hydrogel-based flexible electronic devices. The flexible wearable epidermal sensors assembled by ultra-sensitive polyvinyl alcohol-tannic acid-eutectic gallium-indium (PVA-TA-EGaIn) hydrogels with adhesiveness, rapid self-healing, high electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, and temperature sensitivity. The rigid conductive hydrogel prepared by freeze-thaw cycles shows outstanding tensile/compressive strength (1.13 MPa/4.59 MPa) and toughness (1.9 MJ/m(3)), and reveals excellent fatigue resistance. It also exhibited high conductivity (3.63 S m(-1)) and strain sensitivity (gauge factor = 2.59). In addition, the hydrogels maintained good flexibility and conductivity at 10 degrees C. Besides, the PVA-TA-EGaIn hydrogels shows remoldability, which greatly prolongs the service life of the gel. The composite hydrogels show the potential of building the next generation of multifunctional hydrogel-based flexible wearable sensors in human motion monitoring, voice recognition and medical diagnosis.									75	3	0	0	13	0	77			0266-3538	1879-1050											2021-02-08	WOS:000608630700021

The sensor structure is bioinspired in orb webs, which are multifunctional devices for prey capturing and vibration transmission. The multifunctional feature of the structure is achieved by using transparent resins that present both mechanical and optical properties for structural integrity and strain/deflection transmission as well as the optical signal transmission properties with core/cladding configuration of a waveguide. In this case, photocurable and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) resins are used for the core and cladding, re-spectively. The optical transmission, tensile tests, and dynamic mechanical analysis are performed in the resins and show the possibility of light transmission at the visible wavelength range in conjunction with high flexibility and a dynamic range up to 150 Hz, suitable for wearable applications. The BioMFOS has small dimensions (around 2 cm) and light-weight (0.8 g), making it suitable for wearable application and clothing integration. Characterization tests are performed in the structure by means of applying forces at different locations of the structure. The results show an ultra-high sensitiv-ity and resolution, where forces in the mu N range can be detected and the location of the applied force can also be detec-ted with a sub-millimeter spatial resolution. Then, the BioMFOS is tested on the orientation detection in 3D plane, where a correlation coefficient higher than 0.9 is obtained when compared with a gold-standard inertial measurement unit (IMU). Furthermore, the device also shows its capabilities on the movement analysis and classification in two protocols: finger position detection (with the BioMFOS positioned on the top of the hand) and trunk orientation assessment (with the sensor integrated on the clothing). In both cases, the sensor is able of classifying the movement, especially when ana-lyzed in conjunction with preprocessing and clustering techniques. As another wearable application, the respiratory rate is successfully estimated with the BioMFOS integrated into the clothing. Thus, the proposed multifunctional device opens new avenues for novel bioinspired photonic devices and can be used in many applications of biomedical, biomechanics, and micro/nanotechnology.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			2096-4579												2022-12-04	WOS:000887930600001

Recent advances in wearable bioelectronics directly embedded to the epidermal surface are a promising solution for future epidermal sensing. However, the existing wearable bioelectronics are susceptible to motion artifacts as they lack proper adhesion and conformal interfacing with the skin during motion. Here, we present ultra-conformal, customizable, and deformable drawn-on-skin electronics, which is robust to motion due to strong adhesion and ultra-conformality of the electronic inks drawn directly on skin. Electronic inks, including conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics, are drawn on-demand in a freeform manner to develop devices, such as transistors, strain sensors, temperature sensors, heaters, skin hydration sensors, and electrophysiological sensors. Electrophysiological signal monitoring during motion shows drawn-on-skin electronics' immunity to motion artifacts. Additionally, electrical stimulation based on drawn-on-skin electronics demonstrates accelerated healing of skin wounds. Designing efficient wearable bioelectronics for health monitoring, disease prevention, and treatment, remains a challenge. Here, the authors demonstrate an ultra-conformal, customizable and deformable drawn-on-skin electronics which is robust to motion artifacts and resistant to physical damage.									130	4	0	0	18	0	133			2041-1723												2020-07-30	WOS:000560076500008	32732934

These expectations first indicate the directions, but also raise new challenges for the advancement of energy materials. As one of the critical components in LIBs, the electrolyte connecting the two electrodes is vital for achieving the desired performances in batteries. In this Review, the developments of various liquid electrolytes (organic, ionic liquid, and aqueous electrolytes), solid electrolytes (solid polymer and inorganic solid), as well as gel electrolytes is briefly summarized and discussed. For each type of electrolyte, the challenging issues and possible solutions are discussed. In particular, safety, ionic conductivity, and contact/interface issues are emphasized. Finally, from a composite point of view, strategies for the development of high-performance electrolytes with all-round properties are proposed.									274	17	0	0	7	1	279			2196-0216												2015-01-14	WOS:000347973500002

However, poor adhesion strength and significant mechanical mismatches inevitably cause the interface failure of devices. Herein we report a self-adhesive conductive polymer that possesses low modulus (56.1-401.9 kPa), high stretchability (700%), high interfacial adhesion (lap-shear strength >1.2 MPa), and high conductivity (1-37 S/cm). The self-adhesive conductive polymer is fabricated by doping the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) composite with a supramolecular solvent (beta-cyclodextrin and citric acid). We demonstrated the solution process-based fabrication of self-adhesive conductive polymer-based electrodes for various soft devices, including alternating current electroluminescent devices, electromyography monitoring, and an integrated system for the visualization of electromyography signals during muscle training with an array of alternating current electroluminescent devices. The self-adhesive conductive polymer-based electronics show promising features to further develop wearable and comfortable bioelectronic devices with the physiological electric signals of the human body readable and displayable during daily activities.Poor adhesion and mechanical mismatches may cause interface failure of soft devices.

Nevertheless, the incident freezing and drying behaviors of CHs by using water solvent as the dispersion medium limit their application scopes significantly. Herein, an environment tolerant and ultrastretchable organohydrogel is demonstrated by a simple solvent-replacement strategy, in which the partial water in the as-synthesized polyacrylamide/montmorillonite/carbon nanotubes hydrogel is replaced with the glycerol, leading to excellent temperature toleration (-60 to 60 degrees C) and good stability (30 days under normal environment) without sacrificing the stretchability and conductivity. The organohydrogel exhibits an ultrawide strain sensing range (0-4196%) with a high sensitivity of 8.5, enabling effective detection and discrimination of human activities that are gentle or drastic under various conditions. Furthermore, the organohydrogel is assembled in a single-electrode TENG, which displays excellent energy harvesting ability even under a stretchability of 500% and robustness to directly power wearable electronics in harsh cold conditions. This work inspires a simple route for multifunctional organohydrogel and promises the practical application of flexible and self-powered wearable devices in extreme environments.									124	9	0	0	11	0	125			1616-301X	1616-3028											2021-04-08	WOS:000637984500001

In this context, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) have garnered increasing attention as favorable energy storage devices for flexible electronics, owing to the high capacity, low cost, abundant resources, high safety, and eco-friendliness. Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing flexible ZIBs in the last few years. This work summarizes the recent achievements in the design, fabrication, and characterization of flexible ZIBs. Representative structures, such as sandwich and cable type, are particularly highlighted. Special emphasis is put on the novel design of electrolyte and electrode, which aims to endow reliable flexibility to the fabricated ZIBs. Moreover, current challenges and future opportunities for the development of high-performance flexible ZIBs are also outlined.									358	32	0	0	16	0	365			1613-6810	1613-6829											2019-02-15	WOS:000459722300012	30667603

In particular, hydrogel-based flexible electronic devices with good bio-friendliness, excellent mechanical properties (tensile and compressive), self adhesion, self-healing, and high electrical conductivity are the hot topics of research. Herein, we built up a dynamic redox system using Tara tannin and Fe3+ combined with the Fenton reaction to prepare a multifunctional conductive dual-network interpenetrating hydrogel (Tara-Fe3+-PAA-CSMA), which was fast prepared (1-5 min), low-cost and energy saving (reaction at room temperature). Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) formed the first layer of the network and CSMA (chitosan modified by methacrylic acid) constructed the second layer. The obtained hydrogel has high transmittance and strong UV absorption, excellent tensile properties (900%, 0.75 MPa) and adhesion to a wide range of materials (metals, wood, skin, plastic, etc.). Meanwhile, its good self-healing ability, reliable conductivity and high sensitivity (GF = 5.33, 80% tensile strain) provided the possibility for its application as a conductive strain sensor. The hydrogel sensor can accurately capture several motion signals, such as walking, arm shaking and swallowing. What's more, it can also sharply monitor the vibration of the larynx during vocalization and distinguish different sound information according to the graph obtained. In summary, this work innovatively proposed a Tara tannin-Fe3+ based dynamic redox system that makes it possible to quickly prepare conductive hydrogels at room temperature. It is expected to advance the industrial production of wearable flexible electronic devices.									30	1	0	0	5	0	30			0032-3861	1873-2291											2022-04-28	WOS:000783444100001

In particular, liquid-metal-based sensors are especially promising as they can undergo strains of over 200% without failure. However, current liquid-metal-based strain sensors are incapable of resolving small pressure changes in the few kPa range, making them unsuitable for applications such as heart-rate monitoring, which require a much lower pressure detection resolution. In this paper, a microfluidic tactile diaphragm pressure sensor based on embedded Galinstan microchannels (70 mu m width x 70 mu m height) capable of resolving sub-50 Pa changes in pressure with sub-100 Pa detection limits and a response time of 90 ms is demonstrated. An embedded equivalent Wheatstone bridge circuit makes the most of tangential and radial strain fields, leading to high sensitivities of a 0.0835 kPa(-1) change in output voltage. The Wheatstone bridge also provides temperature self-compensation, allowing for operation in the range of 20-50 degrees C. As examples of potential applications, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) wristband with an embedded microfluidic diaphragm pressure sensor capable of real-time pulse monitoring and a PDMS glove with multiple embedded sensors to provide comprehensive tactile feedback of a human hand when touching or holding objects are demonstrated.									332	11	0	0	25	0	336			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-10-18	WOS:000412925600008	28833673

Although most sweat glucose sensors have targeted applications during exercise and other active stimulation induced-sweat, natural sweating offers an attractive alternative with minimal effect on users that can be accessed during routine and sedentary activities without impeding personal lifestyle and preserves the correlation between blood and sweat glucose. Here, we present a noninvasive sweat glucose sensor with convenient hydrogel patches for rapid sampling of natural perspiration without external activities that stimulate sweating. The wearable hydrogel patch rapidly takes up natural sweat from the hand and serves as a medium for electrochemical sensing. A prussian blue-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene nanocomposite (PB-PEDOT NC) electrode provides cost-effective, stable and excellent electrocatalytic activity in sweat glucose measurements. We demonstrated sweat glucose sensor functionality by long-term measurements of glucose in sweat from human subjects consuming food and drinks. By enabling the analysis of sweat glucose during routine and sedentary activities, the sweat glucose sensor shows great promise for clinical-grade glucose management and enlarges the scope of next-generation noninvasive sensing systems.									31	1	0	0	5	0	32			0039-9140	1873-3573											2022-03-13	WOS:000759059000001	35030501

Conductive polymer composites (CPCs) have been utilized to fabricate strain sensors owing to their lightweight and high flexibility. It is a great challenge to develop flexible and wearable strain sensors with light weight, good skin affinity and gas permeability, high sensitivity and excellent corrosion resistance. In this work, electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofibers were first decorated by graphene through ultra-sonication, followed by polydopamine (PDA) modification and then hydrophobic treatment with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT). The obtained electrical conductive polymer nanofiber composites (CPNCs) have a hierarchical polymer core/graphene shell structure and exhibit super-hydrophobicity even under harsh environments. The introduction of PDA not only improves the interfacial interaction between individual graphene sheets but also the interaction between graphene and the TPU nanofibers. Their mechanical properties including Young's modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break are significantly improved, compared to those of TPU nano-fibrous membranes. When CPNC is used as a strain sensor, it displays high stretchability, controllable sensitivity, excellent cyclical stability and durability. Hence, the nanofiber composite based strain sensor can be attached on the skin for precise monitoring of different human motions, such as tiny and large body movements and thus has promising applications in wearable devices.									148	9	0	0	11	0	152			1359-8368	1879-1069											2020-01-14	WOS:000505108700003

Herein, inspired by human skin, a new strategy was proposed for the fabrication of a double-layer piezoresistive pressure sensor with wide sensing range and high sensitivity. It was based on the utilization of sandpaper as template and MXene for the constructions of micro-protrusion rough surface on polydimethylsiloxane film and electrically conductive pathways, respectively. The prepared sensor demonstrated high sensitivity of 2.6 kPa(-1) in wide linear range of 0-30 kPa, fast response/ recovery time of 40/40 ms and excellent repeatability. Importantly, the sensor was successfully applied for the real-time detection of radial artery heart rate, limb movement, handwriting and vocal cord vocalization. Moreover, the integrated device by the sensors had the capability of identifying and visualizing spatial pressure distribution. The findings conceivably stand out a new methodology to prepare flexible high-performance piezoresistive pressure sensors for wearable electronics, human-computer interaction, intelligent robots and health monitoring.

As the core components, flexible strain sensors integrated with wide working range, high sensitivity, and environment stability, especially in moisture or corrosive environments, remain a huge challenge. Herein, synergistic carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) dual conductive layer decorated elastic rubber band (RB) was successfully developed and treated with hydrophobic fumed silica (Hf-SiO2) for preparing superhydrophobic strain sensor. As expected, stable entangled CNTs layer and ultrasensitive microcracked rGO layer endow the sensor with extremely low detection limit (0.1%), high sensitivity (gauge factor is 685.3 at 482% strain), wide workable strain range (0-482%), fast response/recovery (200 ms/200 ms) and favorable reliability and reproducibility over 1000 cycles. Besides, the constructed Hf-SiO2 coating also makes the sensor exhibit excellent superhydrophobicity, self-cleaning property, and corrosion-resistance. As a proof of concept, our prepared high-performance strain sensor can realize the full-range monitoring of human motions and physiological signals even in the water environment, including pulse, vocalization, joint bending, running, and gesture recognition. Interestingly, it can also be knitted into a tactile electronic textile for spatial pressure distribution measurement. Thus, this study provides a universal technique for the preparation of high-performance strain sensors with great potential applications in the field of next-generation intelligent wearable electronics.

How to endow anisotropy and a wide application temperature range for traditional homogeneous conductive hydrogels and flexible sensors is still a challenge. Herein, a directional freezing method is used to prepare anisotropic MXene conductive hydrogels that are inspired by ordered structures of muscles. Due to the anisotropy of MXene conductive hydrogels, the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity are enhanced in specific directions. The hydrogels have a wide temperature resistance range of -36 to 25 degrees C through solvent substitution. Thus, the muscle-inspired MXene conductive hydrogels with anisotropy and low-temperature resistance can be used as wearable flexible sensors. The sensing signals are further displayed on the mobile phone as images through wireless technology, and images will change with the collected signals to achieve motion detection. Multiple flexible sensors are also assembled into a 3D sensor array for detecting the magnitude and spatial distribution of forces or strains. The MXene conductive hydrogels with ordered orientation and anisotropy are promising for flexible sensors, which have broad application prospects in human-machine interface compatibility and medical monitoring.									84	3	0	0	12	0	86			1616-301X	1616-3028											2021-08-26	WOS:000685947600001

However, the broad applications of flexible electronics are still restricted due to several limitations, including high Young's modulus, poor biocompatibility, and poor responsiveness. Innovative materials aiming for overcoming these drawbacks and boost its practical application is highly desirable. Hydrogel is a class of 3D crosslinked hydrated polymer networks, and its exceptional material properties render it as a promising candidate for the next generation of flexible electronics. Here, the latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state-of-art applications of hydrogel-based flexible electronics in various fields are reviewed. More importantly, the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance is discussed here, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels. Last, perspectives on the current challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel-based multifunctional flexible electronics are provided.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0935-9648	1521-4095											2023-03-12	WOS:000936350600001	36037508

However, cooling technology has remained largely unchanged for more than a century and still relies on cooling the entire space regardless of the number of occupants. Personalized thermoregulation by thermoelectric devices (TEDs) can markedly reduce the cooling volume and meet individual cooling needs but has yet to be realized because of the lack of flexible TEDs with sustainable high cooling performance. Here, we demonstrate a wearable TED that can deliver more than 10 degrees C cooling effect with a high coefficient of performance (COP > 1.5). Our TED is the first to achieve long-term active cooling with high flexibility, due to a novel design of double elastomer layers and high-ZT rigid TE pillars. Thermoregulation based on these devices may enable a shift from centralized cooling toward personalized cooling with the benefits of substantially lower energy consumption and improved human comfort.									230	6	0	0	16	0	231			2375-2548												2019-06-18	WOS:000470125000089	31114803

However, the low healing efficiency of self-healable supercapacitors and the small strain of stretchable supercapacitors are fundamentally limited by conventional polyvinyl alcohol-based acidic electrolytes, which are intrinsically neither self-healable nor highly stretchable. Here we report an electrolyte comprising polyacrylic acid dual crosslinked by hydrogen bonding and vinyl hybrid silica nanoparticles, which displays all superior functions and provides a solution to the intrinsic self-healability and high stretchability problems of a supercapacitor. Supercapacitors with this electrolyte are non-autonomic self-healable, retaining the capacitance completely even after 20 cycles of breaking/healing. These supercapacitors are stretched up to 600% strain with enhanced performance using a designed facile electrode fabrication procedure.									541	35	0	0	40	0	550			2041-1723												2015-12-01	WOS:000367585000001	26691661

In this paper, a wearable sensor patch system that integrates flexible piezoresistive sensor (FPS) and epidermal electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors for cuffless BP measurement is presented. By developing parametric models on the FPS sensing mechanism and optimizing operational conditions, a highly stable epidermal pulse monitoring method is established and beat-to-beat BP measurement from the ECG and epidermal pulse signals is demonstrated. In particular, this study highlights the compromise between sensor sensitivity and signal stability. As compared with the current optical-based cuffless BP measurement devices, the sensing patch requires much lower power consumption (3 nW) and is capable of detecting subtle physiological signal variations, e.g., pre and postexercises, thus providing a promising solution for low-power, real-time, and home-based BP monitoring.									310	14	0	0	26	0	321			1616-301X	1616-3028											2016-02-23	WOS:000371078100004

However, it is still a great challenge to prepare multifunctional wearable strain/pressure sensor with an ultra-low detection limit through a facile and cost-effective method. Here, conductive carbon nanotubes modified silk nonwoven fabric (CNTs/SNWF) composite was successfully prepared by the surface micro-dissolution and adhesion technology (SD&AT). Micromorphology analysis showed that CNTs were adhered firmly on the surface of silk fiber to form an effective conductive network. The conductive CNTs/SNWF-based strain/pressure sensor can detect a strain as low as 0.05% and an ultralow pressure of 10 Pa, showing an ultrahigh discernibility. Besides, it also exhibited excellent sensing stability and reproductivity under different conditions, making it applicable in the field of real-time human movement monitoring. Moreover, electronic skin was also established based on the conductive CNTs/SNWF to recognize different tactile stimulus. Interestingly, the prepared conductive CNTs/SNWF also displayed great applicability for optical and thermal sensing, endowing it with more functionality for next-generation wearable electronics.									38	0	0	0	4	0	38			2522-0128	2522-0136											2022-07-25	WOS:000827379400002

In this paper, an organ-like Ti3C2Tx MXene/metal-organic framework-derived copper oxide (CuO) gas sensor was powered by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on latex and polytetrafluoroethylene for the detection of ammonia (NH3) at room temperature. The peak-to-peak value of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current generated by the prepared TENG can reach up to 810 V and 34 mu A, respectively. The TENG can support a maximum peak power density of 10.84 W.m(-2) and light at least 480 LEDs. Moreover, a flexible TENG under a single-electrode working mode was demonstrated for human movement stimulation, which exhibits great potential in wearable devices. The self-powered NH3 sensor driven by TENG has an excellent response (V-g/V-a = 24.8 @ 100 ppm) at room temperature and exhibits a great potential in monitoring pork quality. Ti3C2Tx MXene and CuO were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS to analyze the properties of the materials.

Herein, we reported a facile sol-gel followed by hydrothermal reduction approach to prepare polypyrrole/reduced graphite oxide aerogel (PPy@rGA) film, which is more oriented to flexible wearable piezoresistive sensors as compared with traditional cylindrical reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel. The strong pi-pi interactions between rGO and PPy enhance the interfacial strength and help to maintain the integrity of the composite aerogel film. Meanwhile, the PPy nanoparticles anchoring on the edges and defects of rGO sheets create more electrically conductive paths when an external pressure is applied, and therefore give rise to significant changes in the resistance value and thus excellent piezoresistive sensing performance. The PPy2@rGA film (pyrrole monomer: graphene oxide is 2:1 wt%)-based piezoresistive sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 0.9 kPa(-1) in a linear range that is of 0 to 1 kPa, a short response time of 165 ms, and a short relaxation time of 132 ms, and is able to withstand 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the wearable sensor is capable of detecting large as well as small human motion. This study shows the feasibility of fabricating wearable piezoresitive sensors from rGO aerogel films reinforced by intrinsically conductive polymers.									75	1	0	0	8	0	75			2522-0128	2522-0136											2021-03-14	WOS:000620413900001

An adhesive radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensor bandage (patch) is reported, which can be made completely intimate with human skin, a distinct advantage for chronological monitoring of biomarkers in sweat. In this demonstration, a commercial RFID chip is adapted with minimum components to allow potentiometric sensing of solutes in sweat, and surface temperature, as read by an Android smartphone app with 96% accuracy at 50 mM Na+ (in vitro tests).

Optional paper microfluidics wick sweat from a sweat porous adhesive allowing flow to the sensor, or the sensor can be directly contacted to the skin. The wearability of the patch has been demonstrated for up to seven days, and includes a protective textile which provides a feel and appearance similar to a standard Band-Aid. Applications include hydration monitoring, but the basic capability is extendable to other mM ionic solutes in sweat (Cl-, K+, Mg2+, NH4+, and Zn2+). The design and fabrication of the patch are provided in full detail, as the basic components could be useful in the design of other wearable sensors.									289	12	0	0	67	0	304			0018-9294	1558-2531											2015-06-01	WOS:000354943400002	25398174

The entire device fabrication process is scalable, enabling facile large-area integration and patterning for mapping spatial pressure distribution. Our gold nanowires-based pressure sensors can be operated at a battery voltage of 1.5V with low energy consumption (<30 mu W), and are able to detect pressing forces as low as 13 Pa with fast response time (<17 ms), high sensitivity (>1.14 kPa(-1)) and high stability (>50,000 loading-unloading cycles). In addition, our sensor can resolve pressing, bending, torsional forces and acoustic vibrations. The superior sensing properties in conjunction with mechanical flexibility and robustness enabled real-time monitoring of blood pulses as well as detection of small vibration forces from music.									1601	92	1	0	109	0	1650			2041-1723												2014-02-01	WOS:000332660100001	24495897

Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low-temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in-depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light-emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET- and VOFET-based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage toward the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0935-9648	1521-4095											2023-02-04	WOS:000914679500001	36124375

Construction of microstructures in dielectrics and electrodes is the dominating approach to improving the performance of capacitive pressure sensors. Herein, we have demonstrated a novel three-dimensional microconformal graphene electrode for ultrasensitive and tunable flexible capacitive pressure sensors. Because the fabrication process is controllable, the morphologies of the graphene that is perfectly conformal with the electrode are controllable consequently. Multiscale morphologies ranging from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers, even to tens of micrometers, have been systematically investigated, and the high-performance capacitive pressure sensor with high sensitivity (3.19 kPa(-1)), fast response (30 ms), ultralow detection limit (1 mg), tunable-sensitivity, high flexibility, and high stability was obtained. Furthermore, an ultrasensitivity of 7.68 kPa(-1) was successfully achieved via symmetric double microconformal graphene electrodes. The finite element analysis indicates that the microstructured graphene electrode can enhance large deformation and thus effectively improve the sensitivity. Additionally, the proposed pressure sensors are demonstrated with practical applications including insect crawling detection, wearable health monitoring, and force feedback of robot tactile sensing with a sensor array. The microconformal graphene may provide a new approach to fabricating controllable microstructured electrodes to enhance the performance of capacitive pressure sensors and has great potential for innovative applications in wearable health-monitoring devices, robot tactile systems, and human-machine interface systems.									208	17	0	0	12	0	216			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-04-24	WOS:000466052800052	30869860

The main objective of this study was to determine if there is evidence of time trends in PA, from cross-sectional studies that assessed PA at different time points using wearable devices (e.g., pedometers and accelerometers). A secondary objective was to quantify the rate of change in PA. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted of English-language studies indexed in PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science (1960-2020) using search terms (time OR temporal OR secular) AND trends AND (steps per day OR pedometer OR accelerometer OR MVPA). Subsequently, a meta-analytic approach was used to aggregate data from multiple studies and to examine specific factors (i.e., sex, age-group, sex and age-group, and PA metric). Results Based on 16 peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted between 1995 and 2017, levels of ambulatory PA are trending downward in developed countries. Significant declines were seen in both males and females (P < 0.001) as well as in children (P = 0.020), adolescents (P < 0.001), and adults (P = 0.004). The average study duration was 9.4 yr (accelerometer studies, 5.3 yr; pedometer studies, 10.8 yr). For studies that assessed steps, the average change in PA was -1118 steps per day over the course of the study (P < 0.001), and adolescents had the greatest change in PA at -2278 steps per day (P < 0.001). Adolescents also had the steepest rate of change over time, expressed in steps per day per decade. Conclusions Evidence from studies conducted in eight developed nations over a 22-yr period indicates that PA levels have declined overall, especially in adolescents. This study emphasizes the need for continued research tracking time trends in PA using wearable devices.									20	0	0	0	7	0	20			0195-9131	1530-0315											2022-05-30	WOS:000798928500010	34559725

Microsupercapacitors have been targeted as a viable route for this purpose, because, though storing less energy than microbatteries, they can be charged and discharged much more rapidly and have an almost unlimited lifetime. In this Review, we discuss the progress and the prospects of integrated miniaturized supercapacitors. In particular, we discuss their power performances and emphasize the need of a three-dimensional design to boost their energy-storage capacity. This is obtainable, for example, through self-supported nanostructured electrodes. We also critically evaluate the performance metrics currently used in the literature to characterize microsupercapacitors and offer general guidelines to benchmark performances towards prospective applications.									623	29	0	0	26	0	628			1748-3387	1748-3395											2017-01-01	WOS:000392042400006	27819693

PTM, including personal cooling, heating, insulation, and thermoregulation, are far more flexible and extensive than the traditional air/liquid cooling garments for the human body. Concomitantly, many new advanced materials and strategies have emerged in this decade, promoting the thermoregulation performance and the wearing comfort of PTM simultaneously. In this review, an overview is presented of the state-of-the-art and the prospects in this burgeoning field. The emerging materials and strategies of PTM are introduced, and classed by their thermal functions. The concept of infrared-transparent visible-opaque fabric (ITVOF) is first highlighted, as it triggers the work on advanced PTM by combining it with radiative cooling, and the corresponding implementations and realizations are subsequently introduced, followed by wearable heaters, flexible thermoelectric devices, and sweat-management Janus textiles. Finally, critical considerations on the challenges and opportunities of PTM are presented and future directions are identified, including thermally conductive polymers and fibers, physiological/psychological statistical analysis, and smart PTM strategies.									184	8	0	0	3	0	188			1614-6832	1614-6840											2020-05-27	WOS:000532297600005

Herein, a urea-mediated foaming strategy is reported for the efficient synthesis of monoliths consisting of nitrogen-enriched mesoporous carbon nanosheets (NPCNs) by prefoaming drying a solution made of polyvinylpyrrolidone, zinc nitrate, and urea at low temperatures, foaming and annealing at high temperatures, and subsequent acid etching. NPCNs have a large lateral size of approximate to 40 mu m, thin thickness of approximate to 55 nm, abundant micropores and mesopores (approximate to 3.8 nm), and a high N-doping value of 9.7 at.%. The NPCNs as the cathode in aZHCs provide abundant zinc storage sites involving both physical and chemical adsorption/desorption of Zn(2+ )ions, and deliver high specific capacities of 262 and 115 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 and 10 A g(-1), and a remarkable areal capacity of approximate to 0.5 mAh cm(-2 ) with a mass loading of 5.3 mg cm(-2), outperforming most carbon cathodes reported thus far. Moreover, safe and flexible NPCNs based quasi-solid-state devices are fabricated, which can withstand drilling and mechanical bending, suggesting their potential applications in wearable devices.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			1613-6810	1613-6829											2022-03-26	WOS:000767947900001	35279955

Herein, a soft conductive hydrogel is rationally designed by proportionally mixing silk fibroin, polyacrylamide, graphene oxide, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). The resultant hydrogel has considerable stretchability and compressibility, which enables it to be assembled into a strain/pressure sensor with a wide sensing range (strain, 2%-600%; pressure, 0.5-119.4 kPa) and reliable stability. Then, the corresponding sensor is capable of monitoring a series of physical signals of the human body (e.g., joint movement, facial gesture, pulse, breathing, etc.). In particular, the hydrogel-based sensor is biocompatible, with no anaphylactic reaction on human skin. More interestingly, this conductive hydrogel exhibits a positive response when it works in a triboelectric nanogenerator; consequently, it lights up 20 commericial green light-emitting diodes. Thus, this silk fibroin-based hydrogel is a kind of multifunctional material toward wearable electronics with versatile applications in health and exercise monitors, soft robots, and power sources.									230	7	0	0	25	0	232			1944-8244	1944-8252											2020-02-25	WOS:000512216900131	31935061

By revisiting the concept of detour phase, we demonstrate high-efficiency holograms with broadband and chiral imaging functionalities. In our devices, the apertures of binary holograms are replaced by subwavelength structured microgratings. We achieve broadband operation from the visible to the near infrared and efficiency as high as 75% in the 1.0 to 1.4 mm range by compensating for the inherent dispersion of the detour phase with that of the subwavelength structure. In addition, we demonstrate chiral holograms that project different images depending on the handedness of the reference beam by incorporating a geometric phase. Our devices' compactness, lightness, and ability to produce images even at large angles have significant potential for important emerging applications such as wearable optics.									240	20	0	0	10	0	245			2375-2548												2016-05-01	WOS:000380073000004	27386518

This unique characteristic has long inspired scientists to develop materials and devices to mimic such a function. However, it requires the complex integration of stretchability, colour-changing and tactile sensing. Here we show an all-solution processed chameleon-inspired stretchable electronic skin (e-skin), in which the e-skin colour can easily be controlled through varying the applied pressure along with the applied pressure duration. As such, the e-skin's colour change can also be in turn utilized to distinguish the pressure applied. The integration of the stretchable, highly tunable resistive pressure sensor and the fully stretchable organic electrochromic device enables the demonstration of a stretchable electrochromically active e-skin with tactile-sensing control. This system will have wide range applications such as interactive wearable devices, artificial prosthetics and smart robots.									662	32	0	1	38	1	679			2041-1723												2015-08-01	WOS:000360351600003	26300307

During the past several years, impressive advances have been made in OFETs, particularly in conjugated polymer-based FETs. Numerous FETs based on high-performance polymers have been developed thanks to the efforts of material design and device optimization. A remarkable mobility of more than 10 cm(2) V-1 s (-1) has been achieved in OFETs, which provides a promising opportunity for applications in flexible displays and wearable devices. This review describes the recent progress of this field from four aspects: basic knowledge, material design strategies, solution-processable techniques, and functional applications of OFETs.

Despite this, there is a lack of in-depth empirical evidence on young people's experiences and uses of healthy lifestyle technologies. In this article we focus on young people's uses of a wearable health device - Fitbit - and the associated health app. Informed by the work of Foucault, the purpose is to investigate the surveillance, self-surveillance and resistance that occur by young people. One hundred 13-14 years olds (53 females, 47 males), from five physical education classes in two UK schools participated. Data were generated through 8 focus group interviews, and the nominal interview group technique was applied. Data were analyzed using key concepts from Foucault's theoretical framework. The results demonstrated that, the daily 10,000 step and calorie burning targets set by the Fitbit device encouraged the young people to do more physical activity. Increases in physical activity occurred because of the self-surveillant practices promoted by the Fitbit through; (i) the monitoring and recording of steps and calories burned, and (ii) peer comparison (or monitoring). Surveillance and self-surveillance practices, however, were clearly connected to health equating to fitness and being 'fit' or not being 'fat'. These narrow interpretations of health, equally, underpinned resistance. Daily step and calorie burning targets, (i) did not sustain young people's engagement with the device beyond a few weeks, (ii) promoted negative feelings, and (iii) the device was resisted because it did not record physical activity accurately as part of young people's daily lives. In turn, the young people resisted the educational value of the Fitbit and demonstrated a sceptical stance toward introducing health devices in school and physical education settings.									101	0	1	0	1	0	102			1357-3322	1470-1243											2019-03-24	WOS:000457147700001

Nonvolatile memories (NVMs) are making inroads into high-capacity storage to replace hard disk drives, fuelling the expansion of the global storage memory market. As silicon-based flash memories are approaching their fundamental limit, vertical stacking of multiple memory cell layers, innovative device concepts, and novel materials are being investigated. In this context, emerging 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and black phosphorous, offer a host of physical and chemical properties, which could both improve existing memory technologies and enable the next generation of low-cost, flexible, and wearable storage devices. Herein, an overview of graphene and related 2D materials (GRMs) in different types of NVM cells is provided, including resistive random-access, flash, magnetic and phase-change memories. The physical and chemical mechanisms underlying the switching of GRM-based memory devices studied in the last decade are discussed. Although at this stage most of the proof-of-concept devices investigated do not compete with state-of-the-art devices, a number of promising technological advancements have emerged. Here, the most relevant material properties and device structures are analyzed, emphasizing opportunities and challenges toward the realization of practical NVM devices.									179	7	0	0	6	0	180			0935-9648	1521-4095											2019-03-15	WOS:000460329300002	30663121

Meanwhile, sensing stability of sensor in wet or corrosive environments should also be considered in practical applications. Here, superhydrophobic microcracked conductive paper-based strain sensor was fabricated by coating conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene on printing paper via dip-coating process and followed by depositing superhydrophobic candle soot layer on its surface. Owing to the ultrasensitive microcrack structure in the conductive coating layer induced by the mismatch of elastic modulus and thermal expansion coefficient between conductive coating layer and paper substrate during the drying process, the prepared paper-based strain sensor exhibited a high sensitivity (gauge factor, GF = 17.4) in the strain range of 0-0.6%, ultralow detection limit (0.1% strain) and good fatigue resistance over 1000 cycles towards bending deformation. Interestingly, it was also applicable for torsion deformation detection, showing excellent torsion angle dependent, repeatable and stable sensing performances. Meanwhile, it displayed brilliant waterproof, self-cleaning and corrosion-resistant properties due to the existence of micro/nano-structured and the low surface energy candle soot layer. As a result, the prepared paper-based strain sensor can effectively monitor a series of large-scale and small-scale human motions even under water environment, showing the great promising in practical harsh outdoor environments. Importantly, it also demonstrated good applicability for spatial strain distribution detection of skin upon body movement when assembled into electronic-skin (E-skin). This study will provide great guidance for the design of next generation wearable strain sensor. (C) 2021 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

Stress-enduring inks are used to print the electrode system and the long serpentine connections to the wireless electronic interface. Dynamic mechanical deformation, bending, and stretching studies illustrate the resilience and compliance of the printed traces against extreme mechanical deformations expected for such on-glove sampling/sensing operation. An organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH)-based biosensor system on the index finger enables rapid on-site detection of organophosphate (OP) nerve-agent compounds on suspicious surfaces and agricultural products following their swipe collection on the thumb finger. The new wireless glove-based biosensor system offers considerable promise for field screening of OP nerve-agents and pesticides in defense and food-safety applications, with significant speed and cost advantages. Such lab-on-a-glove demonstration opens the area of flexible wearable sensors to future on-the-hand multiplexed chemical detection in diverse fields.									196	7	0	0	57	0	201			2379-3694												2017-04-01	WOS:000400541500014	28723187

These devices are equipped with different sensors, algorithms, and accompanying mobile apps. With recent advances in mobile sensor technology, privately collected physical activity data can be used as an addition to existing methods for health data collection in research. Furthermore, data collected from these devices have possible applications in patient diagnostics and treatment. With an increasing number of diverse brands, there is a need for an overview of device sensor support, as well as device applicability in research projects.Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the availability of wrist-worn fitness wearables and analyze availability of relevant fitness sensors from 2011 to 2017. Furthermore, the study was designed to assess brand usage in research projects, compare common brands in terms of developer access to collected health data, and features to consider when deciding which brand to use in future research.Methods: We searched for devices and brand names in six wearable device databases. For each brand, we identified additional devices on official brand websites. The search was limited to wrist-worn fitness wearables with accelerometers, for which we mapped brand, release year, and supported sensors relevant for fitness tracking. In addition, we conducted a Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and ClinicalTrials search to determine brand usage in research projects. Finally, we investigated developer accessibility to the health data collected by identified brands.Results: We identified 423 unique devices from 132 different brands. Forty-seven percent of brands released only one device. Introduction of new brands peaked in 2014, and the highest number of new devices was introduced in 2015. Sensor support increased every year, and in addition to the accelerometer, a photoplethysmograph, for estimating heart rate, was the most common sensor. Out of the brands currently available, the five most often used in research projects are Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit, Apple, and Polar. Fitbit is used in twice as many validation studies as any other brands and is registered in ClinicalTrials studies 10 times as often as other brands.Conclusions: The wearable landscape is in constant change. New devices and brands are released every year, promising improved measurements and user experience. At the same time, other brands disappear from the consumer market for various reasons. Advances in device quality offer new opportunities for research. However, only a few well-established brands are frequently used in research projects, and even less are thoroughly validated.									206	1	0	0	35	0	211			1438-8871												2018-12-28	WOS:000428249500001	29567635

The previous focus has been mainly on monitoring physical parameters such as pressure and strains associated with human activities. Development of an enzyme-based non-invasive wearable electrochemical sensor to monitor biochemical vital signs of health such as the glucose level in sweat has attracted increasing attention recently, due to the unmet clinical needs for the diabetic patients. To achieve this, the key challenge lies in the design of a highly stretchable fiber with high conductivity, facile enzyme immobilization, and strain-insensitive properties. Herein, we demonstrate an elastic gold fiber-based three-electrode electrochemical platform that can meet the aforementioned criteria toward wearable textile glucose biosensing. The gold fiber could be functionalized with Prussian blue and glucose oxidase to obtain the working electrode and modified by Ag/AgCl to serve as the reference electrode; and the nonmodified gold fiber could serve as the counter electrode. The as-fabricated textile glucose biosensors achieved a linear range of 0-500 mu M and a sensitivity of 11.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Importantly, such sensing performance could be maintained even under a large strain of 200%, indicating the potential applications in real-world wearable biochemical diagnostics from human sweat.									147	9	0	0	24	0	149			0003-2700	1520-6882											2019-05-21	WOS:000469304300024	31006229

As one of the most-known n-type metal oxides applied in electronic devices, ZnO nanostructures and their heterostructures with other appropriate materials have been widely applied in the assembly of self-powered UV photodetectors. In this review, the recent research on different types of ZnO-based self-powered UV photodetectors is outlined. ZnO nanostructures with different dimensionalities adopted in these photodetectors are discussed in detail. The influences of specific effects, such as the piezo-phototronic effect, the pyro-phototronic effect, the photo-gating effect, and even their fusions, on modulating the self-powered photo-response of these photodetectors have also been demonstrated. The applications of these photodetectors in UV sensing, environmental recognition, wearable devices, functional devices, and light communication are displayed. Finally, possible opportunities and directions for the future developments of these photodetectors are proposed.

J	Dong, Hui; Sun, Jingchao; Liu, Xingmin; Jiang, Xiaodan; Lu, Shaowei								Highly Sensitive and Stretchable MXene/CNTs/TPU Composite Strain Sensor with Bilayer Conductive Structure for Human Motion Detection								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				14	13			15504	15516				10.1021/acsami.1c23567							Article	APR 6 2022	2022	The universal application of wearable strain sensors in various situations for human-activity monitoring is considerably limited by the contradiction between high sensitivity and broad working range. There still remains a huge challenge to design sensors featuring simultaneous broad working range and high sensitivity. Herein, a typical bilayer-conductive structure Ti3C2Tx MXene/carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composite film was developed by a simple and scalable vacuum filtration process utilizing a porous electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) mat as a skeleton. The MXene/CNTs/TPU strain sensor is composed of two parts: a brittle densely stacked MXene upper lamella and a flexible MXene/CNT-decorated fibrous network lower layer. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of the two parts along with hydrogen-bonding interactions between the porous TPU fiber mat and MXene sheets, the MXene/CNTs/TPU strain sensor possesses both a broad working range (up to 330%) and high sensitivity (maximum gauge factor of 2911) as well as superb long-term durability (2600 cycles under the strain of 50%). Finally, the sensor can be successfully employed for human movement monitoring, from tiny facial expressions, respiration, and pulse beat to large-scale finger and elbow bending, demonstrating a promising and attractive application for wearable devices and human-machine interaction.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252											2022-06-08	WOS:000800295400061	35344347

However, low secretion rates and evaporation pose challenges for collecting resting thermoregulatory sweat for non-invasive analysis of body physiology. Here we present wearable patches for continuous sweat monitoring at rest, using microfluidics to combat evaporation and enable selective monitoring of secretion rate. We integrate hydrophilic fillers for rapid sweat uptake into the sensing channel, reducing required sweat accumulation time towards real-time measurement. Along with sweat rate sensors, we integrate electrochemical sensors for pH, Cl-, and levodopa monitoring. We demonstrate patch functionality for dynamic sweat analysis related to routine activities, stress events, hypoglycemia-induced sweating, and Parkinson's disease. By enabling sweat analysis compatible with sedentary, routine, and daily activities, these patches enable continuous, autonomous monitoring of body physiology at rest. Low secretion rates and evaporation pose challenges for collecting resting thermoregulatory sweat for non-invasive analysis of body physiology.

Wearable sensors have found wide-spread use in recent years due to their ever-decreasing cost, ease of deployment and use, and ability to provide continuous monitoring as opposed to sensors installed at fixed locations. Since many smart phones are now equipped with a variety of sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera, it has become more feasible to develop activity monitoring algorithms employing one or more of these sensors with increased accessibility. We provide a complete and comprehensive survey on activity classification with wearable sensors, covering a variety of sensing modalities, including accelerometer, gyroscope, pressure sensors, and camera-and depth-based systems. We discuss differences in activity types tackled by this breadth of sensing modalities. For example, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer systems have a history of addressing whole body motion or global type activities, whereas camera systems provide the context necessary to classify local interactions, or interactions of individuals with objects. We also found that these single sensing modalities laid the foundation for hybrid works that tackle a mix of global and local interaction-type activities. In addition to the type of sensors and type of activities classified, we provide details on each wearable system that include on-body sensor location, employed learning approach, and extent of experimental setup. We further discuss where the processing is performed, i.e., local versus remote processing, for different systems. This is one of the first surveys to provide such breadth of coverage across different wearable sensor systems for activity classification.									238	6	0	0	8	0	243			1530-437X	1558-1748											2017-02-08	WOS:000391752800021

One challenge associated with the development of such materials is their fabrication method, which requires to be low-cost, scalable, and environmental-friendly. Herein, we developed a full "green" route to fabricate machine-washable conductive textiles by coating textiles with a novel crosslinked and conductive polymer composite coating, using single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and bio-mass derived glucaric acid/chitosan (GA-chitosan) organic salt aqueous solution with dip-coating or spray-coating. The crosslinked SWNTs/GA-chitosan polyamide coatings exhibit a high electrical conductivity of up to 7.4 x 10(2) S/m and high water/organic solvents resistance. The conductive textiles can achieve an exceptional Joule heating performance driven by moderate voltage and exhibit a high electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency of approximately 30 dB at X-band under optimized formulation. The high adhesive energy between the polymer composite coatings and textile substrates enables the ultra-high durability and stability of textiles, confirmed by mechanical deformation, rubbing, and washing tests. This simple and organic solvent-free processing method provides an environmentally friendly, cost-effective fabrication approach, holding great promise for large-scale production of multifunctional conductive wearable textiles for EMI shielding and/or personal heating applications.									54	1	1	0	8	0	55			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-01-12	WOS:000600994100002

However, electric stimulation is still essential for existing optoelectronic synapses to realize bidirectional weight-updating, restricting the processing speed, bandwidth, and integration density of the devices. Herein, a two-terminal optical synapse based on a wafer-scale pyrenyl graphdiyne/graphene/PbS quantum dot heterostructure is proposed that can emulate both the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic behaviors in an optical pathway. The simple device architecture and low-dimensional features of the heterostructure endow the optical synapse with robust flexibility for wearable electronics. This optical synapse features a linear and symmetric conductance-update trajectory with numerous conductance states and low noise, which facilitates the demonstration of accurate and effective pattern recognition with a strong fault-tolerant capability even at bending states. A series of logic functions and associative learning capabilities have been demonstrated by the optical synapses in optical pathways, significantly enhancing the information processing capability for neuromorphic computing. Moreover, an integrated visible information sensing memory processing system based on the optical synapse array is constructed to perform real-time detection, in situ image memorization, and distinction tasks. This work is an important step toward the development of optogenetics-inspired neuromorphic computing and adaptive parallel processing networks for wearable electronics.									112	13	0	0	1	0	114			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-03-25	WOS:000613942700121	33372769

Herein, flexible and highly sensitive capacitive pressure sensors were fabricated based on flexible electrodes with convex microarrays and ultrathin dielectric layer. The proposed sensor is constructed by sandwiching a top micro-arrayed electrode, a middle ultrathin dielectric layer and a bottom micro-arrayed electrode, and it demonstrates an ultra-high sensitivity of 30.2 kPa(-1) (0-130 Pa), fast response time of 25 ms, low detection limit of 0.7 Pa and extreme stability of 100 000 cycles without fatigue. The finite-element analysis indicates that the changes of contact area and distance between two electrodes under external stimulus are critical to achieve superior properties of the sensor. Benefitting from the outstanding comprehensive performance, the enormous potential ability of the capacitive sensor in monitoring physiological signals and robot hand grabbing motions have been successfully demonstrated, which indicates promising applications in wearable intelligent electronic devices.									241	10	0	0	12	0	247			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-04-01	WOS:000521052900006

However, there are still many obstacles to simultaneously satisfy the above critical requirements required by new high-performance EM absorption materials. Herein, for the first time, Ti3C2TX MXenes are selected as the dielectric mediator to prepare reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/Ti3C2TX hybrids foam with hollow core-shell architectures and controllable complex permittivity via self-assembly and sacrificial template processes, under the guidance of theoretical calculations. RGO is grafted flatly on the outer surface of the Ti3C2TX spheres-core, forming a unique heterostructure. The RGO/Ti3C2TX foam possesses excellent EM absorption performance superior to all reported foam-based counterparts, the EAB covers the whole X-band at 3.2 mm while the density is merely 0.0033 g cm(-3), and its specific EM absorption performance (SMAP = RL (dB)/Thickness (cm)/Density (g cm(-3))) value exceeds 14 299.2 dB cm(-2) g(-1), verifying the above theoretical results.

Tactile sensing is a fundamental function of skin and the development of high-performance flexible pressure sensors is necessary to realize thus. Many reports on flexible pressure sensors have been published in recent years, including numerous studies on improving sensor performance, and in particular, sensitivity. In addition, a number of studies have investigated self-healing materials, multifunctional sensing, and so on. Here, we review recent developments in flexible pressure sensors. First, working principles of flexible pressure sensors, including piezoresistivity, capacitance, and piezoelectricity, are introduced, as well as working mechanisms such as triboelectricity. Then studies on improving the performance of piezoresistive and capacitive flexible pressure sensors are discussed, in addition to other important aspects of this intriguing research field.

While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention. The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis. The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.

Meanwhile, incorporating additional novel characters such as transparency and electrochromism can further benefit the development of smart supercapacitors. Nevertheless, the application of the commonly used planar-structural current collectors is seriously restricted by their intrinsic properties such as poor rigidity, large thickness, and limited loading surface area. Flexible and ultralight current collectors with 3D architecture, high conductivity, and easy integration are believed to be the most appropriate alternatives to build high-performance supercapacitors. In this study, a novel and scalable manufacturing technique is developed to produce a flexible and ultralight 3D Ni micromesh (3D NM) current collector for supercapacitor. Flexible smart supercapacitor integrated by 3D NM and high active Ni-Co bimetallic hydroxide (3D NM@NiCo BH) delivers a considerable rate performance (60.6% capacity retention from 1 to 50 mA cm(-2)).

Here, the utilization of bionic microstructures on natural lotus leaves is demonstrated to design and fabricate new-type of high-performance fl exible capacitive tactile sensors. Taking advantage of unique surface micropattern of lotus leave as the template for electrodes and using polystyrene microspheres as the dielectric layer, the proposed devices present stable and high sensing performance, such as high sensitivity (0.815 kPa(-1)), wide dynamic response range (from 0 to 50 N), and fast response time (approximate to 38 ms). In addition, the fl exible capacitive sensor is not only applicable to pressure (touch of a single hair), but also to bending and stretching forces. The results indicate that the proposed capacitive tactile sensor is a promising candidate for the future applications in electronic skins, wearable robotics, and biomedical devices.									313	27	0	0	18	0	323			1613-6810	1613-6829											2016-09-28	WOS:000384684500016	27323288

However, traditional films based on inorganic/organic composite piezoelectric materials face the bottleneck of defects and cracks or poor dispersion, which hinders the performance of pressure sensors. Herein, polydopamine (PDA) was introduced as a surface modification agent to modify barium titanate (BaTiO3, BTO), which was then blended with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix in different ratios to form uniform and homogeneous PDA@BTO/PVDF composites. Afterwards, the flexible piezoelectric pressure sensor was fabricated by a facial solution-casting method. This PDA-modification strategy can improve the dispersion of BTO into PVDF matrix, as well as reduce the interface hole defects and cracks between the two components. As a result, the 17 wt% PDA@BTO/PVDF sensor exhibited a fast response of 61 ms and a remarkable piezoelectric output voltage of 9.3 V, which showed obvious improvement as compared to the pristine PVDF and BTO/PVDF composite counterparts. In addition, as an energy supplier, the sensor could produce a maximum power of 0.122 mu W/cm(2) even with high load resistance of 70 m Omega. This pressure sensor was sensitive to various human motions, showing great potential in the applications of wearable electronics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, thus far, a wearable TE power generator based on commercially available fabrics has not been realized. In this study, nanostructured Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 were synthesized and deposited on both sides of a silk fabric to form TE columns. These TE columns were connected with silver foils to fabricate a prototype integrating an array of 12 thermocouples. The generator could effectively convert thermal energy into electricity in the temperature difference (AT) range of 5-35 K. The maximum voltage and power outputs were similar to 10 mV and similar to 15 nW, respectively, with no significant change in both, during 100 cycles of bending and twisting. Different voltage output profiles were collected from an arm-attached generator before and after 30 min of walking, to highlight the immense potential of the silk fabric-based TE generator. This study provides a new approach for developing fabric-based TE power generators for practical applications in wearable electronics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, it is shown that a MXene/black phosphorus (BP)-based self-powered smart sensor system can be designed by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct-laser-writing micro-supercapacitors and solar cells. Using a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly process to form a periodic interleaving MXene/BP lamellar structure results in a high energy-storage capacity in a direct-laser-writing micro-supercapacitor to drive the operation of sensors and compensate the intermittency of light illumination. Meanwhile, with MXene/BP as the sensitive layer in a flexible pressure sensor, the pressure sensitivity of the device can be improved to 77.61 kPa(-1) at an optimized elastic modulus of 0.45 MPa. Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9 ms) shows a real-time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next-generation self-powered electronics.									108	9	0	0	4	0	108			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-04-30	WOS:000643568000001	33899274

The performance of SCs can be assessed in terms of the electrochemical properties determined through a combination between the electrode and the electrolyte materials. Likewise, the charge storage capacities of SCs can be affected significantly by selection of such materials (e.g., via surface redox mechanisms). Enormous efforts have thus been put to make them more competitive with existing options for energy storage such as rechargeable batteries. This article reviews recent advances in SC technology with respect to charge storage mechanisms, electrode materials, electrolytes (e.g., particularly paper/fiber-like 3D porous structures), and their practical applications. The challenges and opportunities associated with the commercialization of SCs are also discussed.									894	47	1	0	20	1	912			2211-2855	2211-3282											2018-10-01	WOS:000444859700048

Herein, inspired by the black scales of Bitis rhinoceros, a generalized approach via sequential thermal actuations to construct biomimetic 2D-material nanocoatings, including Ti3C2Tx MXene, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is designed. The hierarchical MXene nanocoatings result in broadband light absorption (up to 93.2%), theoretically validated by optical modeling and simulations, and realize improved light-to-heat performance (equilibrium temperature of 65.4 degrees C under one-sun illumination). With efficient light-to-heat conversion, the bioinspired MXene nanocoatings are next incorporated into solar steam-generation devices and stretchable solar/electric dual-heaters. The MXene steam-generation devices require much lower solar-thermal material loading (0.32 mg cm(-2)) and still guarantee high steam-generation performance (1.33 kg m(-2) h(-1)) compared with other state-of-the-art devices. Additionally, the mechanically deformed MXene structures enable the fabrication of stretchable and wearable heaters dual-powered by sunlight and electricity, which are reversibly stretched and heated above 100 degrees C. This simple fabrication process with effective utilization of active materials promises its practical application value for multiple solar-thermal technologies.									209	7	0	0	15	0	210			1614-6832	1614-6840											2019-09-01	WOS:000485920600014

Current sensors, however, suffer from low sensitivity, non-transparency, and lack of self-healing ability. In this study, we synthesized a polyvinyl alcohol/cellulose nanofibril (PVA/CNF) hydrogel with dual-crosslinked networks for highly transparent, stretchable, and self-healing pressure and strain sensors. The hydrogel contains dynamic borate bonds, metal-carboxylate coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonds, all of which contribute to the hydrogel's superior dimensional stability, mechanical strength and flexibility, and spontaneous self-healing ability as compared to traditional PVA hydrogels. The developed hydrogel has a moderate modulus of 11.2 kPa, and a high elongation rate of 1900%. It spontaneously self-heals within 15 s upon contact without any external stimuli, has a high transmittance of over 90%, and has excellent compatibility with human fibroblasts. The capacitive sensor developed based on the PVA/CNF hydrogel has high sensitivity to very subtle pressure changes, such as small water droplets. When used as a strain sensor, it was capable of detecting and monitoring various human motions such as finger, knee, elbow, and head movements, breathing, and gentle tapping. The developed hydrogel and sensors not only show great potential in electronic skin, personal healthcare, and wearable devices, but may also inspire the development of transparent, intelligent skin-like sensors.									144	6	0	0	26	0	148			0925-4005												2019-06-18	WOS:000469849800020

The developed SC uses sweat as the electrolyte and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the active electrode. With PEDOT:PSS coated onto cellulose/polyester cloth, the SC shows specific capacitance of 8.94 F g(-1) (10 mF cm(-2)) at 1 mV s(-1). With artificial sweat, the energy and power densities of the SC are 1.36 Wh kg(-1) and 329.70 W kg(-1), respectively for 1.31 V and its specific capacitance is 5.65 F g(-1). With real human sweat the observed energy and power densities are 0.25 Wh kg(-1), and 30.62 W kg(-1), respectively. The SC performance is evaluated with different volumes of sweat (20, 50, and 100 mu L), bending radii (10, 15, 20 mm), charging/discharging stability (4000 cycles), and washability. With successful on-body testing, the first demonstration of the suitability of a sweat-based SC for self-powered cloth-based sensors to monitor sweat salinity is presented.

Flexible sensors, as a kind of indispensable components of flexible electronics, have been extensively studied. However, wearable airflow sensors capable of monitoring the environment airflow in real time are rarely reported. Herein, by mimicking the spider's fluff, an ultrasensitive and flexible all-textile airflow sensor based on fabric with in situ grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed. The fabric decorated with fluffy-like CNTs possesses exceptionally large contact area, endowing the airflow sensor with superior properties including ultralow detection limit (approximate to 0.05 m s(-1)), multiangle airflow differential response (0 degrees-90 degrees), and fast response time (approximate to 1.3 s). Besides, the fluffy fabric airflow sensor can be combined with a pristine fabric airflow sensor to realize highly sensitive detection in a wide airflow range (0.05-7.0 m s(-1)). Its potential applications including transmitting information according to Morse code by blowing the sensors, monitoring increasing and decreasing airflow velocity, and alerting blind people walking outside about potential hazard induced by nearby fast-moving objects are demonstrated. Furthermore, the airflow sensor can be directly integrated into clothing as stylish designs without sacrificing comfortness. It is believed that the ultrasensitive all-textile airflow sensor holds great promise for applications in smart textiles and wearable electronics.									135	11	0	0	16	0	135			0935-9648	1521-4095											2020-02-10	WOS:000510449600001	32009282

However, the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in air cathodes are obstacles to its flexible and rechargeable application. Herein, a strategy called MOF-on-MOF (MOF, metal-organic framework) is presented for the structural design of air cathodes, which creatively develops an efficient oxygen catalyst comprising hierarchical Co(3)O(4 )nanoparticles anchored in nitrogen-doped carbon nano-micro arrays on flexible carbon cloth (Co3O4@N-CNMAs/CC). This hierarchical and free-standing structure design guarantees high catalyst loading on air cathodes with multiple electrocatalytic activity sites, undoubtedly boosting reaction kinetics, and energy density of an all-solid-state zinc-air battery. The integrated Co3O4@N-CNMAs/CC cathode in an all-solid-state zinc-air battery exhibits a high open circuit potential of 1.461 V, a high capacity of 815 mAh g(-1) Zn at 1 mA cm(-2), a high energy density of 1010 Wh kg(-1) Zn, excellent cycling stability as well as outstanding mechanical flexibility, significantly outperforming the Pt/C-based cathode. This work opens a new door for the practical applications of rechargeable zinc-air batteries in wearable electronic devices.									134	8	0	0	8	0	134				2198-3844											2019-06-18	WOS:000470189500004	31179211

Here a low-cost and facile fabrication strategy to obtain multiscale-structured elastomeric electrodes and a highly sensitive and robust flexible pressure sensor is presented. The principles of spontaneous buckle formation of the PDMS surface and the embedding of silver nanowires are used to fabricate the multiscale-structured elastomeric electrode. By laminating the multiscale-structured elastomeric electrode onto the dielectric layer/bottom electrode template, the pressure sensor can be obtained. The pressure sensor is based on the capacitive sensing mechanism and shows high sensitivity (>3.8 kPa(-1)), fast response and relaxation time (<150 ms), high bending stability and high cycle stability. The fabrication process can be easily scaled up to produce pressure sensor arrays and they can detect the spatial distribution of the applied pressure. It is also demonstrated that the fingertip pressure sensing device can sense the pressure distribution of each finger, when grabbing an object.									275	19	1	0	9	0	286			2040-3364	2040-3372											2015-01-01	WOS:000351934700034	25779911

This trend has only increased in recent years, with numerous high-profile research initiatives and commercial endeavors. An important research theme has emerged as a result, which is the incorporation of semiconducting polymers in various devices that communicate with the nervous system-from wearable brain-monitoring caps to penetrating implantable microelectrodes. This has been driven by the potential of this broad class of materials to improve the electrical and mechanical properties of the tissue-device interface, along with possibilities for increased biocompatibility. In this review we first begin with a tutorial on neural interfacing, by reviewing the basics of nervous system function, device physics, and neuroelectrophysiological techniques and their demands, and finally we give a brief perspective on how material improvements can address current deficiencies in this system. The second part is a detailed review of past work on semiconducting polymers, covering electrical properties, structure, synthesis, and processing.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			0009-2665	1520-6890											2022-04-25	WOS:000781182800003	35089012

Skin-like epidermal electronic technologies can support these use cases in soft and ultrathin materials that conformally interface with the skin in a manner that is mechanically and thermally imperceptible. Nevertheless, schemes so far have limited the overall sizes of these devices to less than a few square centimetres. Here, we present materials, device structures, handling and mounting methods, and manufacturing approaches that enable epidermal electronic interfaces that are orders of magnitude larger than previously realized. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate devices for electrophysiological recordings that enable coverage of the full scalp and the full circumference of the forearm. Filamentary conductive architectures in open-network designs minimize radio frequency-induced eddy currents, forming the basis for structural and functional compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate the use of the large-area interfaces for the multifunctional control of a transhumeral prosthesis by patients who have undergone targeted muscle-reinnervation surgery, in long-term electroencephalography, and in simultaneous electroencephalography and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging.									183	14	0	0	20	0	186			2157-846X												2019-03-01	WOS:000460576800010	30948811

Therefore, it is desirable to design a smart pulse monitoring device to achieve noninvasive and real-time acquisition of cardiovascular parameters. The majority of current pulse sensors are usually bulky or insufficient in sensitivity. In this work, a graphene-based skin-like sensor is explored for pulse wave sensing with features of easy use and wearing comfort. Moreover, the adjustment of the substrate stiffness and interfacial bonding accomplish the optimal balance between sensor linearity and signal sensitivity, as well as measurement of the beat-to-beat radial arterial pulse. Compared with the existing bulky and nonportable clinical instruments, this highly sensitive and soft sensing patch not only provides primary sensor interface to human skin, but also can objectively and accurately detect the subtle pulse signal variations in a real-time fashion, such as pulse waveforms with different ages, pre- and post-exercise, thus presenting a promising solution to home-based pulse monitoring.									215	10	0	0	17	0	217			2379-3694												2017-07-01	WOS:000406829300015	28750520

In nature, there are many well-adapted structures developed through natural selection, which inspired us for the design of biomimetic materials or devices. Particularly, human fingertip skin, where many epidermal ridges amplify external stimulations, might be a good example to imitate for highly sensitive sensors. In this work, based on unique chemical vapor depositions (CVD)-grown 3D graphene films that mimic the morphology of fingertip skin, we fabricated flexible pressure sensing membranes, which simultaneously showed a high sensitivity of 110 (kPa)(-1) for 0-0.2 kPa and wide workable pressure range (up to 75 kPa). Hierarchical structured PDMS films molded from natural leaves were used as the supporting elastic films for the graphene films, which also contribute to the superior performance of the pressure sensors. The pressure sensor showed a low detection limit (0.2 Pa), fast response (< 30 ms), and excellent stability for more than 10,000 loading/unloading cycles. Based on these features, we demonstrated its applications in detecting tiny objects, sound, and human physiological signals, showing its potential in wearable electronics for health monitoring and human/machine interfaces.									145	19	0	0	7	0	147			1998-0124	1998-0000											2018-12-28	WOS:000419959500047

However, a simple, efficient and tunable strategy for preparation of binder-free MXene-based electrodes, especially for developing a general method for fabricating the MXene-based wearable flexible supercapacitors, still remains a challenge to meet the requirements of practical applications. In this study, we fabricated binder-free MXene-based films with adjustable mass loading and reduced agglomeration on the nickel foam and wearable flexible fabric substrates by the modified electrophoretic deposition method using organic colloid containing few-layers Ti3C2Tx nanoflakes. Their electrochemical performances are studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge -discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The binder-free electrodes can deliver high capacitance (similar to 140 F g(-1) in alkaline electrolyte), stable cycling performance with no capacitance loss after 10,000 cycles and good rate performance, which can be attributed to the reduced agglomeration of Ti3C2Tx films with a layer-by-layer self-assembled stackable structure, optimized pore-size distribution (similar to 4 nm) and excellent electronic conductivity, enhancing the accessibility to electrolyte ions and enabling full utilization of the MXene nanoflake surfaces.

Among various strain sensors, the foam-shaped ones have received widespread attention owing to their light weight and gas permeability. However, the working range of these sensors is still not large enough, and the sensitivity needs to be further improved. In this work, we develop a high-performance foam-shaped strain sensor composed of Ti3C2Tx MXene, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). MXene sheets are adsorbed on the surface of a composite foam of MWCNTs and TPU (referred to as TPU/MWCNTs foam), which is prefabricated by using a salt-templating method. The obtained TPU/MWCNTs@MXene foam works effectively as a lightweight, easily processable, and sensitive strain sensor. The TPU/MWCNTs@MXene device can deliver a wide working strain range of similar to 100% and an outstanding sensitivity as high as 363 simultaneously, superior to the state-of-the-art foam-shaped strain sensors. Moreover, the composite foam shows an excellent gas permeability and suitable elastic modulus close to those of skin, indicating its being highly comfortable as a wearable sensor. Owing to these advantages, the sensor works effectively in detecting both subtle and large human movements, such as joint motion, finger motion, and vocal cord vibration. In addition, the sensor can be used for gesture recognition, demonstrating its perspective in human-machine interaction. Because of the high sensitivity, wide working range, gas permeability, and suitable modulus, our foam-shaped composite strain sensor may have great potential in the field of flexible and wearable electronics in the near future.									105	7	0	0	11	0	108			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-06-04	WOS:000665748900041	34086439

However, foreign body response and performance loss over time are major challenges stemming from the chemomechanical mismatch between sensors and tissues. Herein, microgels are utilized as large crosslinking centers in hydrogel networks to modulate the tradeoff between modulus and fatigue resistance/stretchability for producing hydrogels that closely match chemomechanical properties of neural tissues. The hydrogels exhibit notably different characteristics compared to nanoparticles reinforced hydrogels. The hydrogels exhibit relatively low modulus, good stretchability, and outstanding fatigue resistance. It is demonstrated that the hydrogels are well suited for fashioning into wearable and implantable sensors that can obtain physiological pressure signals, record the local field potentials in rat brains, and transmit signals through the injured peripheral nerves of rats. The hydrogels exhibit good chemomechanical match to tissues, negligible foreign body response, and minimal signal attenuation over an extended time, and as such is successfully demonstrated for use as long-term implantable sensory devices. This work facilitates a deeper understanding of biohybrid interfaces, while also advancing the technical design concepts for implantable neural probes that efficiently obtain physiological information.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23				2198-3844											2022-04-14	WOS:000776477000001	35362243

The inherent inaccessibility of sweat in sedentary individuals in large volume (>= 10 mu L) for on-demand and in situ analysis has limited our ability to capitalize on this noninvasive and rich source of information. A wearable and miniaturized iontophoresis interface is an excellent solution to overcome this barrier. The iontophoresis process involves delivery of stimulating agonists to the sweat glands with the aid of an electrical current. The challenge remains in devising an iontophoresis interface that can extract sufficient amount of sweat for robust sensing, without electrode corrosion and burning/ causing discomfort in subjects. Here, we overcame this challenge through realizing an electrochemically enhanced iontophoresis interface, integrated in a wearable sweat analysis platform. This interface can be programmed to induce sweat with various secretion profiles for real-time analysis, a capability which can be exploited to advance our knowledge of the sweat gland physiology and the secretion process. To demonstrate the clinical value of our platform, human subject studies were performed in the context of the cystic fibrosis diagnosis and preliminary investigation of the blood/sweat glucose correlation. With our platform, we detected the elevated sweat electrolyte content of cystic fibrosis patients compared with that of healthy control subjects. Furthermore, our results indicate that oral glucose consumption in the fasting state is followed by increased glucose levels in both sweat and blood.

However, existing ionic actuators still need a technology breakthrough for larger bending strain, faster response, and excellent actuation durability. Herein, we report a novel highly electro-responsive ionic actuator based on functional carboxylated cellulose nanofibers (CCNF) by doping with ionic liquid (IL) and graphene nanoplatelets (GN). The proposed CCNF-IL-GN actuator demonstrated a large tip displacement of 15.71 mm (peak-to-peak) at 2.0 V with 0.1 Hz, faster rise time (2.9s), broad frequency bandwidth (0.1-3.0 Hz), markedly reduced phase delay, and long actuation durability (98.6% retention for 3 h) without actuation response distortion, all of which were due to the fast-easy ion migration and massive charge transport ability of the designed ionically crosslinked electrolyte membrane, resulting from the strong ionic interactions and crosslinking of CCNF nanofibers with IL and GN. Furthermore, we investigated the actuator's bionic applications such as the bionic flower, bionic finger, and bionic window. These results elucidate the great potential of the designed CCNF-IL-GN actuators for bionic robots, soft robots, wearable electronics, and biomedical active devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0266-3538	1879-1050											2022-12-29	WOS:000895855500001

In this paper, the authors propose a high-performance flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator based on piezoelectrically enhanced nanocomposite micropillar array of polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE))/barium titanate (BaTiO3) for energy harvesting and highly sensitive self-powered sensing. By a reliable and scalable nanoimprinting process, the piezoelectrically enhanced vertically aligned P(VDF-TrFE)/BaTiO3 nanocomposite micropillar arrays are fabricated. The piezoelectric device exhibits enhanced voltage of 13.2 V and a current density of 0.33 mu A cm(-2), which an enhancement by a factor of 7.3 relatives to the pristine P(VDF-TrFE) bulk film. The mechanisms of high performance are mainly attributed to the enhanced piezoelectricity of the P(VDF-TrFE)/BaTiO3 nanocomposite materials and the improved mechanical flexibility of the micropillar array. Under mechanical impact, stable electricity is stably generated from the nanogenerator and used to drive various electronic devices to work continuously, implying its significance in the field of consumer electronic devices.

Various carbon materials are widely used as electrode materials in supercapacitors. However, their intrinsically low specific capacitance and relatively low bulk density lead to a relatively low volumetric performance, significantly limiting their future application. This critical review points out the crucial importance of volumetric performance and reviews recent achievements of high volumetric performances obtained through the rational design and development of novel carbon-based materials. Particular emphasis is focused on discussing the factors influencing the volumetric performance of carbon materials from a structural design point of view. We then make an in-depth summary of various promising approaches used to make significant research breakthroughs in recent years. Current challenges, future research directions and opportunities in this fascinating field of supercapacitors with high gravimetric and volumetric performances are also discussed.									957	62	0	0	34	0	969			1754-5692	1754-5706											2016-01-01	WOS:000372243600003

For practical applications, pressure sensors with high sensitivity and low detection limit are desired. Here, ta simple process to fabricate high-performance pressure sensors based on biomimetic hierarchical structures and highly conductive active membranes is presented. Aligned carbon nanotubes/graphene (ACNT/G) is used as the active material and microstructured polydimethylsiloxane (m-PDMS) molded from natural leaves is used as the flexible matrix. The highly conductive ACNT/G films with unique coalescent structures, which are directly grown using chemical vapor deposition, can be conformably coated on the m-PDMS films with hierarchical protuberances. Flexible ACNT/G pressure sensors are then constructed by putting two ACNT/G/PDMS films face to face with the orientation of the ACNTs in the two films perpendicular to each other. Due to the unique hierarchical structures of both the ACNT/G and m-PDMS films, the obtained pressure sensors demonstrate high sensitivity (19.8 kPa(-1), <0.3 kPa), low detection limit (0.6 Pa), fast response time (<16.7 ms), low operating voltage (0.03 V), and excellent stability for more than 35 000 loading-unloading cycles, thus promising potential applications in wearable electronics.									442	40	0	0	23	0	449			1616-301X	1616-3028											2017-03-03	WOS:000395409200019

However, it is still a critical challenge for pressure sensors to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and wide sensing range while performing well in response time, stability, reliability and wearing comfortability. Here, conductive MXene/cotton fabric was fabricated using the simple dip-coating technique and then sandwiched between polydimethylsiloxane film and an interdigitated electrode for flexible wearable piezoresistive pressure sensor. The abundant hydroxyl groups of cotton fabric and functional groups of MXene were beneficial for the good adhesion of conductive MXene nanosheets onto the entangled fiber networks, constructing effective conductive network. Taking advantage of the excellent flexibility and three-dimensional porous structure of cotton fabric and the special sandwich architecture of the sensor, the MXene/cotton fabric (MCF) based pressure sensor exhibited high sensitivity (5.30 kPa(-1) in the pressure range of 0-1.30 kPa), broad sensing range (0-160 kPa), rapid response/recovery time (50 ms/20 ms), excellent stability and long-term durability. Moreover, the MCF based pressure sensor can be employed to detect and distinguish various human health signals, including finger motion, early stage Parkinson's static tremor and wrist pulse. Importantly, E-skin was also designed based on the MCF based pressure sensor for the recognition of different tactile stimuli, exhibiting promising potential in next generation wearable electronics.									170	8	0	0	14	0	170			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-06-15	WOS:000664789900002

However, most of hydrogel-based sensors exhibit poor mechanical properties. Here, a robust, flexible and strain-sensitive conductive wearable sensor is prepared based on dual physically cross-linked double network hydrogels consisting of core-shell hybrid nanoparticles cross-linked polyacrylamide as first network and Ca2+ cross-linked alginate as second network. Dynamic physical cross-linking as sacrifice bonds can effectively dissipate energy and reconstruct the network structure, endowing hydrogels with high strength, toughness, stretchability and excellent self-recovery properties. Moreover, the hydrogels exhibit outstanding strain sensitive behavior with repeatable, stable, and precise changes in resistance signals. Based on the excellent strain sensitivity, the hydrogel can be assembled as a wearable strain sensor to monitor joint motions such as finger, wrist, elbow, neck, and knee joints, and even the slight motions including breathing and speaking. Thus, the tough, anti-fatigue, self-recovery and conductive hydrogels have promising potential as soft, high-performance and flexible wearable strain sensor for soft robots, biomimetic prostheses, human activity monitoring and health-monitoring systems.									160	7	0	0	28	0	164			1385-8947	1873-3212											2018-12-28	WOS:000445413900079

Herein, a muscle-fiber-inspired nonwoven piezoelectric textile with tunable mechanical properties for wearable physiological monitoring is developed. To mimic the muscle fibers, polydopamine (PDA) is dispersed into the electrospun barium titanate/polyvinylidene fluoride (BTO/PVDF) nanofibers to enhance the interfacial-adhesion, mechanical strength, and piezoelectric properties. Such improvements are both experimentally observed via mechanical characterization and theoretically verified by the phase-field simulation. Taking the PDA@BTO/PVDF nanofibers as the building blocks, a nonwoven light-weight piezoelectric textile is fabricated, which hold an outstanding sensitivity (3.95 V N-1) and long-term stability (<3% decline after 7,400 cycles). The piezoelectric textile demonstrates multiple potential applications, including pulse wave measurement, human motion monitoring, and active voice recognition. By creatively mimicking the muscle fibers, this work paves a cost-effective way to develop high-performance and self-powered wearable bioelectronics for personalized healthcare.									161	2	0	0	12	0	159			1616-301X	1616-3028											2021-02-25	WOS:000614929000001

Targeting aforementioned issues, herein, we report the facile fabrication of a highly sensitive and reliable capacitive pressure sensor for ultralow-pressure measurement by sandwiching MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) composite nanofibrous scaffolds as a dielectric layer between biocompatible poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly- styrene sulfonate /polydimethylsiloxane electrodes. The fabricated sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 0.51 kPa(-1) and a minimum detection limit of 1.5 Pa. In addition, it also enables linear sensing over a broad pressure range (0-400 kPa) and high reliability over 10,000 cycles even at extremely high pressure (>167 kPa). The sensitivity of the nanofiber-based sensor is enhanced by MXene loading, thereby increasing the dielectric constant up to 40 and reducing the compression modulus to 58% compared with pristine PVDF-TrFE nanofiber scaffolds. The proposed sensor can be used to determine the health condition of patients by monitoring physiological signals (pulse rate, respiration, muscle movements, and eye twitching) and also represents a good candidate for a next generation human-machine interfacing device.									194	8	0	0	8	0	198			1944-8244	1944-8252											2020-06-05	WOS:000535246100107	32302099

In this work, graphene woven fabrics (GWFs) are explored for highly sensitive sensing. A flexible and wearable strain sensor is assembled by adhering the GWFs on polymer and medical tape composite film. The sensor exhibits the following features: ultra-light, relatively good sensitivity, high reversibility, superior physical robustness, easy fabrication, ease to follow human skin deformation, and so on. Some weak human motions are chosen to test the notable resistance change, including hand clenching, phonation, expression change, blink, breath, and pulse. Because of the distinctive features of high sensitivity and reversible extensibility, the GWFs based piezoresistive sensors have wide potential applications in fields of the displays, robotics, fatigue detection, body monitoring, and so forth.									811	49	1	0	55	0	834			1616-301X	1616-3028											2014-08-06	WOS:000340461400011

In particular, wearable iHMI systems have attracted tremendous attention owing to their potential for use in personal mobile electronics and the Internet of Things. Although signifi cant progress has been made in the development of iHMI systems, those based on rigid electronics have constraints in terms of wearability, comfortability, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and aesthetics. Herein the fabrication of a transparent and stretchable iHMI system composed of wearable mechanical sensors and stimulators is reported. The ultrathin and lightweight design of the system allows superior wearability and high SNR. The use of conductive/piezoelectric graphene heterostructures, which consist of poly(L-lactic acid), single-walled carbon nanotubes, and silver nanowires, results in high transparency, excellent performance, and low power consumption as well as mechanical deformability. The control of a robot arm for various motions and the feedback stimulation upon successful executions of commands are demonstrated using the wearable iHMI system.									447	29	0	0	25	0	458			1616-301X	1616-3028											2015-01-21	WOS:000347897000004

Herein, a facile and efficient two-step vacuum assisted filtration followed by hot-pressing approach is presented to fabricate versatile electrical heaters based on the high-performance aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and highly conductive Ag nanowires (AgNWs). The resultant ANF/AgNW nanocomposite papers present ultraflexibility, extremely low sheet resistance (minimum R-s of 0.12 Omega/sq), and outstanding heat resistance (thermal degradation temperature above 500 degrees C) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 285.7 MPa, tensile modulus of 6.51 GPa with a AgNW area fraction of 0.4 g/m(2)), benefiting from the partial embedding of AgNWs into the ANF substrate and the extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions. Moreover, the ANF/AgNIV nanocomposite paper-based electrical heaters exhibit satisfyingly high heating temperatures (up to similar to 200 degrees C) with rapid response time (10-30 s) at low AgNW area fractions and supplied voltages (0.5-5 V) and possess sufficient heating reliability, stability, and repeatability during the long-term and repeated heating and cooling cycles. Fully functional applications of the ANF/AgNW nanocomposite paper-based electrical heaters are demonstrated, indicating their excellent potential for emerging electronic applications such as wearable devices, artificial intelligence, and high-performance heating systems.									242	14	0	0	19	0	244			1936-0851	1936-086X											2019-08-13	WOS:000477786400024	31244039

Here, we report the use of an implantable two-way neural interface for wireless, multichannel streaming of field potentials in five individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) for up to 15 months after implantation. Bilateral four-channel motor cortex and basal ganglia field potentials streamed at home for over 2,600 h were paired with behavioral data from wearable monitors for the neural decoding of states of inadequate or excessive movement. We validated individual-specific neurophysiological biomarkers during normal daily activities and used those patterns for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS). This technological approach may be widely applicable to brain disorders treatable by invasive neuromodulation.An implanted device in the brain enables wireless neural monitoring and stimulation for up to 15 months following implantation.									83	3	0	0	38	0	85			1087-0156	1546-1696											2021-05-27	WOS:000646548400004	33941932

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted on collected data (n = 363) using the AMOS 22 statistical software. The reliability and validity of the measurement assessing the proposed factor structure were examined via CFA, while the strength and direction of the hypothesized causal paths among the constructs were analyzed via SEM.Findings - The AQ and RA of smart watches were found to be associated with perceived usefulness, while the sense of MB and AV induced by smart watches led to a greater perceived ease of the technology's use. The results also indicated that the devices' subcultural appeal and cost were notable antecedents of user attitude (AT) and intention to use, respectively.Originality/value - Though smart watches are becoming increasingly popular, empirical studies on user perceptions of and ATs toward - them remain preliminary. This paper is one of the first scholarly attempts at a systematic prediction of smart watch usage, with implications for the adoption of future wearable technology.									274	0	0	1	7	0	275			1066-2243												2015-08-26	WOS:000359055600002

However, to make these technologies truly pervasive, stable and easily processable, n-doped conducting polymers are also needed. Despite major efforts, no n-type equivalents to the benchmark PEDOT:PSS exist to date. Here, we report on the development of poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline):poly(ethyleneimine) (BBL:PEI) as an ethanol-based n-type conductive ink. BBL:PEI thin films yield an n-type electrical conductivity reaching 8Scm(-1), along with excellent thermal, ambient, and solvent stability. This printable n-type mixed ion-electron conductor has several technological implications for realizing high-performance organic electronic devices, as demonstrated for organic thermoelectric generators with record high power output and n-type organic electrochemical transistors with a unique depletion mode of operation. BBL:PEI inks hold promise for the development of next-generation bioelectronics and wearable devices, in particular targeting novel functionality, efficiency, and power performance. The development of n-type conductive polymer inks is critical for the development of next-generation opto-electronic devices that rely on efficient hole and electron transport.

Herein, a novel microchannel-confined MXene-based flexible piezoresistive sensor is demonstrated to simultaneously achieve multi-types micro-force sensing of pressure, sound, and acceleration. Benefiting from the synergistically confined effect of the fingerprint-microstructured channel and the accordion-microstructured MXene materials, the as-designed sensor remarkably endows a low detection limit of 9 Pa, a high sensitivity of 99.5 kPa(-1), and a fast response time of 4 ms, as well as non-attenuating durability over 10 000 cycles. Moreover, the fabricated sensor is multifunctionally capable of sensing sounds, micromotion, and acceleration in one device. Evidently, such a multifunctional sensing characteristic can highlight the bright prospect of the microchannel-confined MXene-based micro-force sensor for the higher integration of flexible electronics.									191	10	0	0	14	0	192			1616-301X	1616-3028											2020-02-03	WOS:000509357500001

Herein, a tactile hydrogel sensor (THS) based on micro-pyramid-patterned double-network (DN) ionic organohydrogels to detect subtle pressure changes by measuring the variations of triboelectric output signal without an external power supply is reported. By the first time of pyramidal-patterned hydrogel fabrication method and laminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) encapsulation process, the self-powered THS shows the advantages of remarkable flexibility, good transparency (approximate to 85%), and excellent sensing performance, including extraordinary sensitivity (45.97 mV Pa-1), fast response (approximate to 20 ms), very low limit of detection (50 Pa) as well as good stability (36 000 cycles). Moreover, with the LiBr immersion treatment method, the THS possesses excellent long-term hyper anti-freezing and anti-dehydrating properties, broad environmental tolerance (-20 to 60 degrees C), and instantaneous peak power density of 20 mu W cm(-2), providing reliable contact outputs with different materials and detecting very slight human motions. By integrating the signal acquisition/process circuit, the THS with excellent self-power sensing ability is utilized as a switching button to control electric appliances and robotic hands by simulating human finger gestures, offering its great potentials for wearable and multi-functional electronic applications.									59	3	0	0	3	0	60				2198-3844											2022-02-06	WOS:000748514200001	35098703

At 6 months, the interventions added telephone counseling sessions, text message prompts, and access to study materials on a website. At 6 months, participants randomized to the standard intervention group initiated self-monitoring of diet and physical activity using a website, and those randomized to the enhanced intervention group were provided with a wearable device and accompanying web interface to monitor diet and physical activity.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of weight was measured over 24 months at 6-month intervals, and the primary hypothesis tested the change in weight between 2 groups at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and dietary intake. RESULTS Among the 471 participants randomized (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40; age range, 18-35 years; 28.9% nonwhite; 77.2% women), 470 (233 in the standard intervention group, 237 in the enhanced intervention group) initiated the interventions as randomized, and 74.5% completed the study. Weight change at 24 months differed significantly by intervention group (difference, 2.4 kg [95% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P = .002). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups.[GRAPHICS]CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among young adults with a BMI between 25 and less than 40, the addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activitymay not offer an advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches.									335	1	2	0	54	4	337			0098-7484	1538-3598											2016-09-20	WOS:000383484100016	27654602

However, the sustained development of high-performance ZIBs is hindered by the limited availability of cathode materials. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate MoS2 with expanded inter-layer spacing (E-MoS2) can be a promising cathode candidate for rechargeable and flexible ZIBs. By X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman studies, a reversible Zn2+ ion intercalation/deintercalation mechanism was revealed. The E-MoS2 electrode delivers a specific capacity of 202.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), a desirable energy density of 148.2 Wh kg(-1) and good cycle stability with a capacity retention ratio of 98.6% over 600 cycles. By using the newly-developed starch/polyacrylamide (PAM) based polymer electrolyte with high zinc ion conductivity, a quasi-solid Zn/E-MoS2 battery was developed, which exhibits decent electrochemical performance even under various heavy deformations, holding great potential for applications in future flexible and wearable devices.									297	17	0	0	10	0	298			2405-8297												2019-06-14	WOS:000469207500012

However, existing non-invasive approaches, including photoplethysmography and tonometry, only enable access to the superficial peripheral vasculature. Although current ultrasonic technologies allow non-invasive deep tissue observation, unstable coupling with the tissue surface resulting from the bulkiness and rigidity of conventional ultrasound probes introduces usability constraints. Here, we describe the design and operation of an ultrasonic device that is conformal to the skin and capable of capturing blood pressure waveforms at deeply embedded arterial and venous sites. The wearable device is ultrathin (240 mu m) and stretchable (with strains up to 60%), and enables the non-invasive, continuous and accurate monitoring of cardiovascular events from multiple body locations, which should facilitate its use in a variety of clinical environments.									385	14	0	0	54	0	391			2157-846X												2018-09-01	WOS:000444282800013	30906648

Herein, a very simple, low-cost and solution-based approach is presented to fabricate versatile piezoresistive sensors based on conductive polyurethane (PU) sponges coated with synergistic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene. These sensor materials are fabricated by convenient dip-coating layer-by-layer (LBL) electrostatic assembly followed by in situ reduction without using any complicated microfabrication processes. The resultant conductive MWCNT/RGO@PU sponges exhibit very low densities (0.027-0.064 g cm(-3)), outstanding compressibility (up to 75%) and high electrical conductivity benefiting from the porous PU sponges and synergistic conductive MWCNT/RGO structures. In addition, the MWCNT/RGO@PU sponges present larger relative resistance changes and superior sensing performances under external applied pressures (0-5.6 kPa) and a wide range of strains (0-75%) compared with the RGO@PU and MWCNT@PU sponges, due to the synergistic effect of multiple mechanisms: "disconnect-connect" transition of nanogaps, microcracks and fractured skeletons at low compression strain and compressive contact of the conductive skeletons at high compression strain. The electrical and piezoresistive properties of MWCNT/RGO@PU sponges are strongly associated with the dip-coating cycle, suspension concentration, and the applied pressure and strain. Fully functional applications of MWCNT/RGO@PU sponge-based piezoresistive sensors in lighting LED lamps and detecting human body movements are demonstrated, indicating their excellent potential for emerging applications such as health monitoring, wearable devices and artificial intelligence.									203	17	0	0	15	0	209			2040-3364	2040-3372											2018-04-21	WOS:000430537200040	29616263

Ideally, very large area high-performance electrode materials are continuously produced at high speed, which are later constructed into flexible supercapacitors of different shapes and sizes. Here we report the synthesis of very large area MnO2 nanosheets on a 10 mu m thin carbon nanotube film using a facile hydrothermal reaction. The strong and flexible CNT-MnO2 nanosheet composite film demonstrates excellent faradaic pseudocapacitance when used as electrodes for flexible supercapacitors that can be reconfigured from planar supercapacitor to stretchable threadlike supercapacitors. A narrow strip of the CNT-MnO2 electrode can also be scrolled and twisted together with a negative electrode fabricated by synthesizing FeSe2 nanonuts on a carbon fibre to construct a novel coaxial yarn asymmetric supercapacitor. This architecture has shown a very high energy density up to 27.14 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 571.3 W kg(-1) and a good capacity retention after 8000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, together with excellent flexibility and long lifespan.									138	10	0	0	4	0	142			1385-8947	1873-3212											2019-05-27	WOS:000467042200016

The past four decades have witnessed the rapid development of electrochromic technology; however, it remains severely developmentally challenged due to its limited practical applications. Predictably, as a colour control technology that gives visual information readable by the naked eye, electrochromism should have much wider applications by applying the visualization technique to various functional devices. Indeed, some recent research findings show that integrating electrochromic technology with other advanced technologies has imparted a new strong impetus for the further development of electrochromic technology. However, a systematic review of the literature on the fusing of electrochromic technology with other advanced technologies is still lacking, demonstrating the urgent need for further studies, although there are some review papers on electrochromic energy storage devices. In this review, we systematically discuss the recent advances in the fusing of electrochromic technology with other advanced technologies, including wearable technology, thermal control technology, energy storage technology, energy harvesting technology and sensing technology. The integration modes, design principles and performance optimization for different types of interdisciplinary electrochromic devices are highlighted. Finally, an outlook concerning future trends and issues in the research field is also provided.									166	13	0	0	4	0	167			0927-796X	1879-212X											2020-05-14	WOS:000528779100003

Established sweat monitoring technologies use simple fabric swatches and are limited to basic analysis in controlled laboratory or hospital settings. We present a collection of materials and device designs for soft, flexible, and stretchable microfluidic systems, including embodiments that integrate wireless communication electronics, which can intimately and robustly bond to the surface of the skin without chemical and mechanical irritation. This integration defines access points for a small set of sweat glands such that perspiration spontaneously initiates routing of sweat through a microfluidic network and set of reservoirs. Embedded chemical analyses respond in colorimetric fashion to markers such as chloride and hydronium ions, glucose, and lactate. Wireless interfaces to digital image capture hardware serve as a means for quantitation. Human studies demonstrated the functionality of this microfluidic device during fitness cycling in a controlled environment and during long-distance bicycle racing in arid, outdoor conditions. The results include quantitative values for sweat rate, total sweat loss, pH, and concentration of chloride and lactate.									746	28	1	0	160	1	763			1946-6234	1946-6242											2016-11-23	WOS:000389449400005	27881826

However, the scalable assembly of flexible ZIBs is still a challenge. Here, a scalable assembly strategy is developed to fabricate flexible ZIBs with an ultrathin all-in-one structure by combining blade coating with a rolling assembly process. Such a unique all-in-one integrated structure can effectively avoid the relative displacement or detachment between neighboring components to ensure continuous and effective ion- and/or loading-transfer capacity under external deformation, resulting in excellent structural and electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the ultrathin all-in-one ZIBs can be tailored and edited controllably into desired shapes and structures, further extending their editable, stretchable, and shape-customized functions. In addition, the ultrathin all-in-one ZIBs display the ability to integrate with perovskite solar cells to achieve an energy harvesting and storage integrated system. These enlighten a broad area of flexible ZIBs to be compatible with highly flexible and wearable electronics. The scaling-up assembly strategy provides a route to design other ultrathin all-in-one energy storage devices with stretchable, editable, and customizable behaviors.									71	6	0	0	7	0	72			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-02-16	WOS:000614018700001	33533121

With polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as polymer matrix, the sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films are prepared via electrospinning-laying-hot pressing technology, where Fe3O4/PVA composite electrospun nanofibers in the top and bottom layers and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite electrospun nanofibers in the middle layer. Owing to the electrospinning process and the successful construction of the sandwich structure, when the amounts of Ti3C2Tx and Fe3O4 are respectively only 13.3 and 26.7 wt%, the EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of the sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films reach 40 dB with the thickness of 75 mu m, higher than that of (Fe3O4/Ti3C2Tx)/PVA EMI shielding nanocomposite films (21 dB) prepared based on blending-electrospinning-hot pressing process under the same amounts of fillers. Furthermore, the prepared sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films possess excellent thermal conductivities and mechanical properties. This novel kind of flexible sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films with excellent EMI shielding performances, thermal conductivities, and mechanical properties presents broad application prospects in the fields of EMI shielding and protection for high-power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.									244	50	0	0	11	0	246			1613-6810	1613-6829											2021-09-23	WOS:000695745600001	34523229

Herein, the vertically interconnected conductive networks are constructed based on a meshy template of weave cotton fabrics with interwoven warp and weft yarns. The two-dimensional early transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes), with unique metallic conductivity and hydrophilic surfaces, are uniformly and intimately attached to the preformed fabric via a spray-drying coating approach. Through adjusting the spray-drying cycles, the degree of conductive interconnectivity for the fabrics is precisely tuned, thereby affording highly conductive and breathable fabrics with integrated Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and strain sensing performances. Interestingly, triggered by the interwoven conductive architecture, the MXene-decorated fabrics with a low loading of 6 wt % (0.78 mg cm(-2)) offer an outstanding electrical conductivity of 5 Omega sq(-1).

However, the traditional approaches based on the multistep fabrication processes for constructing the fiber-shaped energy device still encounter persistent restrictions in fabrication procedure, scalability, and mechanical durability. To overcome this critical challenge, an all-in-one coaxial fiber-shaped asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) device is realized by a direct coherent multi-ink writing three-dimensional printing technology via designing the internal structure of the coaxial needles and regulating the rheological property and the feed rates of the multi-ink. Benefitting from the compact coaxial structure, the FASC device delivers a superior areal energy/power density at a high mass loading, and outstanding mechanical stability. As a conceptual exhibition for system integration, the FASC device is integrated with mechanical units and pressure sensor to realize high-performance self-powered mechanical devices and monitoring systems, respectively.									84	6	0	0	1	0	85			2375-2548												2021-02-10	WOS:000608481000029	33523905

The gas-sensing characteristics of exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) connected to interdigitated metal electrodes were investigated. The MoS2 flake-based sensor detected a NO2 concentration as low as 1.2 ppm and exhibited excellent gas-sensing stability. Instead of metal electrodes, patterned graphene was used for charge collection in the MoS2-based sensing devices. An equation based on variable resistance terms was used to describe the sensing mechanism of the graphene/MoS2 device. Furthermore, the gas response characteristics of the heterostructured device on a flexible substrate were retained without serious performance degradation, even under mechanical deformation. This novel sensing structure based on a 2D heterostructure promises to provide a simple route to an essential sensing platform for wearable electronics.									308	16	0	0	15	0	311			1944-8244	1944-8252											2015-08-05	WOS:000359279800076	26161691

Although supercapacitors (SCs) have been known for more than fifty years, only recently these devices have been considered as promising candidates to fulfil this significant technology gap. Developments in nanotechnology and manufacturing techniques applied to high-performance advanced electrode materials have accelerated progress in this fast-moving field. In this comprehensive overview article, we systematically survey the current state of art on fabrication and the corresponding electrochemical performance of electrode materials for SCs. The text covers novel carbon nanomaterials having different dimensions, such as 0D-carbon quantum dots, 1D-carbon nanostructures (carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon nano yarns and their composites) as well as 2D-carbon materials (graphene, doped-graphene, graphene derivatives and their composites). Emerging fabrication technologies are also addressed, including conventional SCs, as well as asymmetric, flexible, micro, stretchable and wearable devices. Additionally, the drawbacks for each class of electrode material, the major challenges facing the current technologies, and some of the promising research directions in this field have also been discussed.

However, practical applications of WSSCs are still limited by the relatively poor performances, owing to the challenges in the rational modification of one-dimensional (1D) substrates with sophisticated nanostructure. Herein, we demonstrate a WSSC by virtue of material exploration and fabrication strategy. A 1D nanoarray electrode consisting of CuO nonowires core and CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanoplatelets shell supported on a copper wire is prepared with fine control over the structure/morphology, which displays a largely improved specific capacitance, high rate capability and long cycling lifespans. Based on this sophisticated core-shell nanostructure, a flexible all-solid-state asymmetric WSSC was fabricated, which exhibits excellent supercapacitive performances with a high energy density (1.857 mWh cm(-3)) and long-term cycling stability (99.5% device capacitance retention over 2000 cycles). By virtue of the versatility of metal wire substrates, transition metal oxides and LDHs materials, the synthesis strategy presented here can be extended to the fabrication of other portable and flexible micro energy storage devices.

To reduce their effects, scientists are focusing on improving energy harvesting-based power generators. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have demonstrated their ability to directly convert thermal energy into an electrical one via the Seebeck effect. Also, they are environmentally friendly because they do not contain chemical products, they operate silently because they do not have mechanical structures and/or moving parts, and they can be fabricated on many types of substrates like silicon, polymers, and ceramics. Furthermore, TEGs are position-independent, present a long operating lifetime and are suitable for integration into bulk and flexible devices. This paper presents in-depth analysis of TEGs, starting by an extensive description of their working principle, types (planar, vertical and mixed), used materials, figure of merit, improvement techniques including different thermoelectric materials arrangement (conventional, segmented and cascaded), and used technologies and substrates types (silicon, ceramics and polymers). This manuscript also describes the exploitation of TEGs in various fields starting from low-power applications (medical and wearable devices, IoT: internet of things, and WSN: wireless sensor network) to high-power applications (industrial electronics, automotive engines, and aerospace).

AbstractIn recently years, high-performance wearable strain sensors have attracted great attention in academic and industrial. Herein, a conductive polymer composite of electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibrous film matrix-embedded carbon black (CB) particles with adjustable scaffold network was fabricated for high-sensitive strain sensor. This work indicated the influence of stereoscopic scaffold network structure built under various rotating speeds of collection device in electrospinning process on the electrical response of TPU/CB strain sensor. This structure makes the sensor exhibit combined characters of high sensitivity under stretching strain (gauge factor of 8962.7 at 155% strain), fast response time (60 ms), outstanding stability and durability (>10,000 cycles) and a widely workable stretching range (0-160%). This high-performance, wearable, flexible strain sensor has a broad vision of application such as intelligent terminals, electrical skins, voice measurement and human motion monitoring. Moreover, a theoretical approach was used to analyze mechanical property and a model based on tunneling theory was modified to describe the relative change of resistance upon the applied strain.

Herein, vertically oriented Co9S8@MnO2 core-shell heterostructure nanotube arrays are in situ grown on the carbon cloth surface and activated by oxygen vacancy engineering via a fast NaBH4 reduction method.

Further, the assembled Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor has a higher energy density of 198.857 Wh kg(-1), which is about twice than that of AAS devices.

However, they often possess a relatively low energy density and limited mechanical stretchability. Here, we report an all-in-one planar micro-supercapacitor arrays (MSCAs) based on hybrid electrodes with ultrathin ZnP nanosheets anchored on 3D laser-induced graphene foams (ZnP@LIG) arranged in island-bridge device architecture. The hybrid electrodes with a large specific surface area demonstrate excellent ionic and electrical conductivities, impressive gravimetric (areal) capacitance of 1425 F g(-1) (7.125 F cm(-2)) at 1 A g(-1), and long-term stability. In addition to high energy (245 m Wh cm(-2)) and power (12.50 mW kg(-1) at 145 m Wh cm(-2)) densities, the MSCAs with excellent cycling stability also showcase adjustable voltage and current outputs through serial and parallel connections of MSC cells in the island-bridge design, which also allows the system to be reversibly stretched up to 100%. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations validated by UV-vis absorption spectra partially suggest that the enhanced capacitance and rate capability may result from the improved electrical conductivity and number of adsorbed charged ions (Na+ in Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and K+ in PVA/KCl gel electrolyte) on the pseudocapacitive non-layered ultrathin ZnP nanosheets. The integration of the all-in-one stretchable MSCAs with a crumpled Au-based triboelectric nanogenerator and stretchable crumpled graphene-based strain sensor demonstrates a self-powered stretchable system. The coupled design principle of electronic materials and device architecture provides a promising method to develop high-performance wearable/stretchable energy storage devices and self-powered stretchable systems for future bio-integrated electronics.									108	10	0	0	4	0	110			2211-2855	2211-3282											2021-03-01	WOS:000620327200004

Conductive nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles and nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, are promising building blocks for printed electronics. Nanomaterial-based printing technologies, formulation of printable inks, post-printing treatment, and integration of functional devices have progressed substantially in the recent years. This review summarizes basic principles and recent development of common printing technologies, formulations of printable inks based on conductive nanomaterials, deposition of conductive inks via different printing techniques, and performance enhancement by using various sintering methods. While this review places emphasis on conductive nanomaterials, the printing techniques and ink formulations can be applied to other materials such as semiconducting and insulating nanomaterials. Moreover, some applications of printed flexible and stretchable electronic devices are reviewed to illustrate their potential. Finally, the future challenges and prospects for printing conductive nanomaterials are discussed.									291	4	0	0	12	0	294			2365-709X												2019-05-01	WOS:000471813400008

Here, we provide experimental demonstration of electromagnetic skyrmions based on magnetic localized spoof plasmons (LSP) showing large topological robustness against continuous deformations, without stringent external interference conditions. By directly measuring the spatial profile of all three vectorial magnetic fields, we reveal multiple pi-twist target skyrmion configurations mapped to multi-resonant near-equidistant LSP eigenmodes. The real-space skyrmion topology is robust against deformations of the meta-structure, demonstrating flexible skyrmionic textures for arbitrary shapes.

With the development of wearable electronic systems, humidity sensors have attracted great attention in human body-related (HBR) humidity detection (such as respiratory behavior, speech recognition, skin moisture, non-contact switch, and diaper monitoring).

They are useful in a series of applications such as excellent performance in biosensing and environmental monitoring, due to their large specific surface area and high porosity. The wide range of materials used provide a solid foundation and core guarantee for electrospun NFs to sense, which are used in a variety of polymers, small molecules, colloidal particles, and composites.

However, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate the multiple functions on the textile substrates without sacrificing their intrinsic properties. Herein, we report a novel and facile vapor phase polymerization (VPP) and spray-coating strategy towards the construction of a laminated film containing a PEDOT film and Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets on the fiber surface. The fabricated PEDOT/MXene decorated cotton fabrics are integrated with excellent electrochemical performance, joule heating performance, good electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and strain sensing performance. The resultant multifunctional textiles have a low sheet resistance of 3.6 omega sq(-1), and the assembled all-solid-state fabric supercapacitors exhibit an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1000.2 mF cm(-2), which exceeds the state-of-the-art MXene-based fabric supercapacitors. In addition, the PEDOT/MXene modified fabrics exhibit an exceptional joule heating performance of 193.1 degrees C at the applied voltage of 12 V, high EMI shielding effectiveness of 36.62 dB, and high sensitivity as strain sensors for human motion detection. This work provides a novel strategy for the structure design of multifunctional textiles and will lay the foundation for the development of multifunctional wearable electronics.									66	4	0	0	3	0	66			2040-3364	2040-3372											2021-03-02	WOS:000612999200037	33434252

Gold and platinum alloy nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited onto the microfabricated rGO surface and chitosan-glucose oxidase composites were integrated onto the modified surface of the working electrode to develop a human sweat-based wearable glucose sensor application. The fabricated biosensor exhibited excellent amperometric response to glucose at a detection range of 0-2.4 mM (covers the glucose range in sweat), with a sensitivity of 48 mu A/mMcm(2), a short response time (20 s), and high linearity (0.99). The detection limit for glucose was calculated as 5 mu m. The human sweat/mixing glucose samples initially used for testing indicated acceptable detection performance and stability for low glucose concentrations. These results confirm that the proposed nanostructured composite flexible working electrode and fabrication process are highly promising for application as human sweat-based electrochemical glucose sensors.									211	6	0	0	41	0	214			0956-5663	1873-4235											2018-06-30	WOS:000430778400011	29529511

The real possibility of wearing an analytical device with diverse configurations-sweatband, patches, garments-without disturbing the welfare of the carrier has enabled potentiometric ion sensors both as health quality and sport performance controllers. Recent studies show a large involvement of WPISs in the following of critical biomarkers (timely or continuously), such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium and chloride, which are present at relatively high concentrations in sweat (similar to mM levels). Certainly, the non-invasive nature of WPISs and other significant features, e.g., simplicity and cost-effectiveness, have broadened new horizons in relation to applied analytical chemistry. This has been pointed out in the literature over the last decade with the predominance of two analytical outcomes: (i) the improvement of sport performance as a result of continuous detection of ions in sweat (health status of the individual) while decreasing physiological complications (injuries, muscle cramps, fatigue and dehydration) during practice; and (ii) advancements in clinical diagnostics and preventive medicine as a consequence of the monitoring of the health status of patients suffering from any kind of disorder. Beyond the undeniable importance of the integration of WPISs to satisfy current societal needs, the following crucial questions about misleading and missing analytical features need to be answered: To what extent is WPIS technology a reliable analytical tool for the quantification of ions? Is cross-validation the current bottleneck toward further progress? Which are the fundamental steps involving the ion-selective electrode side that would benefit WPIS outcomes? Why is sweat the main (and almost the only) biological fluid to be monitored by WPISs? What is the best sampling strategy to be incorporated into WPIS devices for on-body monitoring of sweat? Which precision limits should be considered to assure a reliable decision-making process? Accordingly, this review focuses on the progression of WPISs from an analytical perspective-merely our vision of the field-within the period between 2010 and 2018. An updated search using specific keywords (wearable, ion, potentiometry, sensor) provided 43 contributions, which are herein highlighted, with a sustainable acceleration over the last three years. Thus, this review describes the current state of WPIS technology, the construction of wearable all-solid-state potentiometric sensors, critical requirements of potentiometric sensors to be fulfilled in a wearable configuration and key features regarding the ideal implementation of WPISs as reliable messengers of physiological information in real scenarios.

Still, it is a big challenge to fulfill excellent compatibility and precisely monitoring of the complexly subtle physiological signals simultaneously. Here, we prepared a three-dimensional hierarchically interlocked PVDF/ZnO nanofiber-based piezoelectric sensor through epitaxial growing ZnO nano rods (NRs) on the surface of electrospun PVDF nanofibers, which enables the fiber-based physiological monitoring electronics (PME) of well flexibility and high gas permeability. Due to synergistic piezoelectric effect of the effectively deformed interlocked ZnO NRs and the uniformly orientated PVDF nanofibers with high electroactive phase, the sensitivities of PME in both pressing and bending modes have been greatly improved 6 times and 41 times than that of pure PVDF nanofibers respectively. On this basis, the designed PME can precisely detect the complexly subtle physiological signals of respiration, wrist pulse and muscle behavior. Moreover, a sensitive gait recognition system was successfully developed based on PME arrays. Therefore, this proposed fiber-based device provides an alternative strategy to monitor the human subtle physiological signals and demonstrates promising potential in the expanded application of healthcare and clinical diagnosis.									144	3	0	0	10	0	144			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-06-01	WOS:000532790600002

However, further application of hydrogels is restricted by the ambiguity of the sensing mechanisms, and the multi-functionalization of flexible sensing systems based on hydrogels in terms of cost, difficulty in integration, and device fabrication remains a challenge, obstructing the specific application scenarios. Herein, cost-effective, structure-specialized and scenario-applicable 3D printing of direct ink writing (DIW) technology fabricated two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (MXenes) bonded hydrogel sensor with excellent strain and temperature sensing performance is developed. Gauge factor (GF) of 5.7 (0 - 191% strain) and high temperature sensitivity (-5.27% degrees C-1) within wide working range (0 - 80 degrees C) can be achieved. In particular, the corresponding mechanisms are clarified based on finite element analysis and the first use of in situ temperature-dependent Raman technology for hydrogels, and the printed sensor can realize precise temperature indication of shape memory solar array hinge.Cost effective device fabrication of powerful hydrogel sensors remains challenging. Here, the authors propose a cost-effective and structure-specialized direct ink writing technique for the fabrication of two-dimensional MXene bonded hydrogel sensors with excellent strain and temperature sensing performance.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41				2041-1723											2022-06-26	WOS:000811535600010	35701412

For many applications, polarization-insensitive metasurfaces are highly desirable, and appear to limit the choice of their constituent elements to isotropic nanostructures. This greatly restricts the number of geometric parameters available in design. Here, we demonstrate a polarization-insensitive metalens using otherwise anisotropic nanofins which offer additional control over the dispersion and phase of the output light. As a result, we can render a metalens achromatic and polarization-insensitive across nearly the entire visible spectrum from wavelength lambda = 460 nm to 700 nm, while maintaining diffraction-limited performance. The metalens is comprised of just a single layer of TiO2 nanofins and has a numerical aperture of 0.2 with a diameter of 26.4 mu m. The generality of our polarization-insensitive design allows it to be implemented in a plethora of other metasurface devices with applications ranging from imaging to virtual/augmented reality.									269	31	0	0	10	0	282			2041-1723												2019-01-21	WOS:000456164800012	30664662

Various natural materials or living organisms consisting of hierarchical or interlocked structures exhibit combinations of properties (e.g., natural elasticity and flexibility) that do not occur in conventional materials. The interlocked epidermal dermal micro bridges in human skin have excellent elastic moduli, which enhance and amplify received tactile signal transport. Herein, we use the sensing mechanisms inspired by human skin to develop Ti3C2/ natural microcapsule biocomposite films that are robust and deformable by mimicking the micro/nanoscale structure of human skin-such as the hierarchy, interlocking, and patterning. The interlocked hierarchical structures can be used to create biocomposite films with excellent elastic moduli (0.73 MPa), capable of high deformability in response to various external stimuli, as verified by employing theoretical studies. The flexible sensor with a hierarchical and interlocked structure (24.63 kPa(-1)) achieves a 9.4 -fold increase in pressure sensitivity compared to that of the planar structured Ti3C2-based flexible sensor (2.61 kPa(-1)). This device also exhibits a rapid response rate (14 ms) and good cycling reproducibility and stability (5000 times). In addition, the flexible pressure device can be used to detect and discriminate signals ranging from finger motion and human pulses to voice recognition.									245	29	0	0	29	0	248			1936-0851	1936-086X											2019-08-01	WOS:000484077800063	31330103

Nevertheless, the performance of conventional designs deteriorates significantly as a result of electrode/electrolyte exposure to atmosphere as well as mechanical deformations for the case of flexible systems. In this study, we suggest an all-transparent stretchable electrochromic supercapacitor device with ultrastable performance, which consists of Au/Ag core-shell nanowire-embedded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), bistacked WO3 nanotube/PEDOT:PSS, and polyacrylamide (PAAm)-based hydrogel electrolyte. Au/Ag core-shell nanowire-embedded PDMS integrated with PAAm-based hydrogel electrolyte prevents Ag oxidation and dehydration while maintaining ionic and electrical conductivity at high voltage even after 16 days of exposure to ambient conditions and under application of mechanical strains in both tensile and bending conditions. WO3 nanotube/PEDOT:PSS bistacked active materials maintain high electrochemical-electrochromic performance even under mechanical deformations. Maximum specific capacitance of 471.0 F g(-1) was obtained with a 92.9% capacity retention even after 50 000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, high coloration efficiency of 83.9 cm(2) C-1 was shown to be due to the dual coloration and pseudocapacitor characteristics of the WO3 nanotube and PEDOT:PSS thin layer.									233	13	0	0	10	0	234			1936-0851	1936-086X											2019-03-01	WOS:000462950500042	30779547

In recent years, there has been huge interest in designing innovative TCEs to replace the conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, which suffer from complex fabrication issues and are incompatible with flexible, wearable electronic devices. In this regard, TCEs based on metal meshes are considered to be the best candidates because of their inherently high electrical conductivity, optical transparency, mechanical robustness and, more importantly, cost-competitiveness. In this review, we describe the technology developments of metal mesh-based transparent conductors and their applications in organic optoelectronic devices, including organic and perovskite solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, supercapacitors, electrochromic devices etc. Specifically, we discuss the fundamental features, optoelectronic properties, fabrication techniques and device applications of metal mesh TCEs. We also highlight the important criteria for evaluating the performance of metal mesh electrodes and propose some new research directions in this emerging field.									184	9	0	0	4	0	187			2050-7526	2050-7534											2019-02-07	WOS:000459724600001

Owing to its unique architecture and synergy of the three components, the as-prepared hybrid paper exhibits flexible and lightweight features as well as superb microwave absorption performance. Maximum absorption intensity with reflection loss as low as - 63 dB can be achieved, and its broadest frequency absorption bandwidth of 5.8 GHz almost covers the entire Ku band.

Based on the advanced 3D structural design, the maximum peak power density of 3D textile can reach 263.36 mW m(-2) under the tapping frequency of 3 Hz, which is several times more than that of conventional 2D textile TENGs. Besides, its collected power is capable of lighting up a warning indicator, sustainably charging a commercial capacitor, and powering a smart watch. The 3D textile TENG can also be used as a self-powered active motion sensor to constantly monitor the movement signals of human body. Furthermore, a smart dancing blanket is designed to simultaneously convert biomechanical energy and perceive body movement. This work provides a new direction for multifunctional self-powered textiles with potential applications in wearable electronics, home security, and personalized healthcare.									253	13	0	0	14	0	256			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-10-11	WOS:000412452500018	28786510

This delivery route allows both convenient and painless drug delivery and a sustained release profile with reduced side effects. However, physiological barriers in the skin undermine the delivery efficiency of conventional patches, limiting drug candidates to small-molecules and lipophilic drugs. Recently, transdermal drug delivery technology has advanced from unsophisticated methods simply relying on natural diffusion to drug releasing systems that dynamically respond to external stimuli. Furthermore, physical barriers in the skin have been overcome using microneedles, and controlled delivery by wearable biosensors has been enabled ultimately. In this review, we classify the evolution of advanced drug delivery strategies based on generations and provide a comprehensive overview. Finally, the recent progress in advanced diagnosis and therapy through customized drug delivery systems based on real-time analysis of physiological cues is highlighted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This inadequate sensitivity stems from the Poisson effect in conventional strain sensors, where stretched elastomer substrates expand in the longitudinal direction but compress transversely. In stretchable strain sensors, expansion separates the active materials and contributes to the sensitivity, while Poisson compression squeezes active materials together, and thus intrinsically limits the sensitivity. Alternatively, auxetic mechanical metamaterials undergo 2D expansion in both directions, due to their negative structural Poisson's ratio. Herein, it is demonstrated that such auxetic metamaterials can be incorporated into stretchable strain sensors to significantly enhance the sensitivity. Compared to conventional sensors, the sensitivity is greatly elevated with a 24-fold improvement. This sensitivity enhancement is due to the synergistic effect of reduced structural Poisson's ratio and strain concentration. Furthermore, microcracks are elongated as an underlying mechanism, verified by both experiments and numerical simulations. This strategy of employing auxetic metamaterials can be further applied to other stretchable strain sensors with different constituent materials. Moreover, it paves the way for utilizing mechanical metamaterials into a broader library of stretchable electronics.									285	15	1	0	15	0	293			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-03-22	WOS:000428348000020	29380896

Wearable respiratory sensors present an exciting opportunity to monitor human respiratory behaviors in a real-time, noninvasive, and comfortable way. Among them, fiber-shaped triboelectric nanogenerators (FS-TENGs) are attractive for their comfort and high degree of freedom. However, the single-electrode FS-TENGs cannot respond to their own tensile strains, and the coaxial double-electrode FS-TENGs show low sensitivity to strain due to structural limitations. Here, a type of helical fiber strain sensor (HFSS) is developed, which can respond to tiny tensile strains. In addition, a smart wearable real-time respiratory monitoring system is developed based on the HFSSs, which can measure some key breathing parameters for disease prevention and medical diagnosis. An intelligent alarm can automatically call a preset mobile phone for help in response to respiratory behavior changes. This work provides an effective helical structure for fabricating highly sensitive strain sensors based on FS-TENGs and develops wearable self-powered real-time respiratory monitoring systems.									44	2	0	0	3	0	45			1936-0851	1936-086X											2022-04-22	WOS:000776691400097	35098711

Although graphene fiber (GF) has full of vigor and tremendous potentiality as promising linear electrode for wire-shaped SCs, simultaneously achieving its facile fabrication process and satisfactory electrochemical performance still remains challenging to date. Herein, two novel types of graphene hybrid fibers, namely ferroferric oxide dots (FODs)@GF and N-doped carbon polyhedrons (NCPs)@GF, have been proposed via a simple and efficient chemical reduction-induced fabrication. Synergistically coupling the electroactive units (FODs and NCPs) with conductive graphene nanosheets endows the fiber-shaped architecture with boosted electrochemical activity, high flexibility and structural integrity. The resultant FODs@GF and NCPs@GF hybrid fibers as linear electrodes both exhibit excellent electrochemical behaviors, including large volumetric specific capacitance, good rate capability, as well as favorable electrochemical kinetics in ionic liquid electrolyte. Based on such two linear electrodes and ionogel electrolyte, a high-performance wire-shaped SC is effectively assembled with ultrahigh volumetric energy density (26.9 mW.h.cm(-3)), volumetric power density (4900 mW.cm(-3)) and strong durability over 10,000 cycles under straight/bending states. Furthermore, the assembled wire-shaped SC with excellent flexibility and weavability acts as efficient energy storage device for the application in wearable electronics.

However, most of flexible pressure sensors need elaborate nanostructure design, and thus their manufacture is consuming and complicated. Therefore, a large-scale and low-cost technology is highly desirable to fabricate flexible pressure sensitive materials with high sensitivity in broad pressure range. Here, an MXene-sponge was fabricated by a simple and efficient dipping-coating process method and was applied in the piezoresistive sensor with insulating Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) nanowires as a spacer. The sensor based on MXene-sponge presents high sensitivity for a broad pressure range (147 kPa(-1) for less than 5.37 kPa region and 442 kPa(-1) for 5.37-18.56 kPa region), a low detection limit of 9 Pa, a rapid response time of 138 ms, and an excellent durability over 10,000 cycles. Human physiological signal (such as respiration, joint movement and pulses) can be real-time monitored by the MXene-sponge sensor. The potential applications of the sensor in measuring pressure distribution and human-machine interaction are also explored.									316	27	0	0	22	0	329			2211-2855	2211-3282											2018-12-28	WOS:000438076200010

The resultant hybrid paper exhibits high flexibility and structural stability. The multidimensional paper architecture possesses several advantages, including rendering an efficient electron/ion transport network, buffering the volume expansion of Fe1-xS nanoparticles, mitigating the dissolution of polysulfides, and enabling superior kinetics toward efficient sodium storage.

However, the weak mechanical properties, low sensitivity and the absence of multifunctionalities (e.g., self-healing, self-adhesive, etc.) of the conventional conductive hydrogels limit their applications. Thus, developing multifunctional hydrogels may address some of these technical issues. In this work, a multifunctional conductive hydro gel strain sensor is fabricated by incorporating a conductive polymer Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) into a mechanically robust poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/ poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) double network (DN) hydrogel. The as-prepared hydrogel sensor could span a wide spectrum of mechanical properties by simply tuning the polymer composition and the number of freezing-thawing cycles. In addition, the dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions endow the hydrogel sensor with self healing property and reversible adhesiveness on diverse substrates. Moreover, the hydrogel sensor shows high sensitivity (Gauge Factor from 2.21 to 3.82) and can precisely detect some subtle human motions (e.g., pulse and vocal cord vibration).

The TENG has a peak-to-peak voltage of 500 V and maximum output power of 378 mu W. The tribotronic constant voltage source is achieved by integrating TENG with voltage rectifier and stabilizer circuits to steadily power the humidity sensor. The performance of the self-powered triboelectric humidity sensor (TEHS) at different humidity levels was systematically investigated, which exhibits high steady output voltage (0-24 V), fast response/recovery time (4 s/3 s for 33%RH, 6 s/15 s for 97%RH), wide sensing range (0-97%RH), great stability, and ultralow power consumption (29.78 mu W). Furthermore, the TEHS demonstrated the potential ability of monitoring human breath with differ frequency, human cough, and finger approach in various applications for humidity sensing. This work provides a novel thought to design the self-powered humidity sensor, and also proposes the promising applications of TENG for the self-powered electronic devices.									189	11	0	0	9	0	190			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-01-01	WOS:000504828100040

These sensors should, in particular, provide a stable electrical output without being affected by external variables such as induced strain. Here, we report circuit design strategies that can improve the accuracy and robustness of a temperature sensor based on stretchable carbon nanotube transistors. Using static and dynamic differential readout approaches, our circuits suppress strain-dependent errors and achieve a measured inaccuracy of only +/- 1 degrees C within a uniaxial strain range of 0-60%. We address device variability by using a one-time, single-point calibration approach. In contrast with previous approaches, which infer temperature change through a normalized measurement at two temperatures, our prototype devices provide an absolute output without temperature cycling. This is essential for practical deployment because heating and cooling the sensor is prohibitively slow and costly during real-time operation and production testing.									213	16	0	0	21	0	218			2520-1131												2018-03-01	WOS:000444073800012

One of the key factors for these devices is the hydrogel electrolyte. In this work, firstly we constructed an anti-freezing, self-healing, adhesive and tough conductive double network ionic organohydrogel by simultaneously introducing NaCl and glycerol (Gly) into poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(acrylic amide-acrylic acid) (PVA/PAMAA). Then, based on this organohydrogel, a strain sensor and a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor were assembled separately and their properties were measured. The fabricated strain sensor showed a highly sensitive response (gauge factor = 8.303) in a broad strain range (from 500 to 1000%), enabling the accurate and reliable detection of various mechanical deformations. Meanwhile, the flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor demonstrated a specific capacitance of 75.75 mF cm(-2), high cycling stability (90.2% retention rate after 5000 cycles) and excellent mechanical stability. Lastly, a self-powered integrated system composed of the strain sensor and flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor was fabricated. The sensor can be driven by the supercapacitor and operate stably in a wide strain range sensing test with low power consumption. More importantly, the self-powered integrated system could be directly attached to the human body to detect human motions, showing its great potential application in wearable devices. This work would enlarge the research and application of high-performance ionic hydrogel electrolytes.									128	8	0	0	17	0	129			2051-6347	2051-6355											2020-08-01	WOS:000554851500010

In this paper, a facile and scalable strategy is proposed to fabricate a porous foam sensor based on carbon black/polydimethylsiloxane (CB/PDMS). CB particles were decorated onto the surface of the cell walls and some particles were embedded into PDMS matrix after the ultrasonication treatment. The density and porosity of the foam are 0.13 g/cm(3) and 76.1%, respectively. A very high linear working range (up to 91%), an excellent response stability, a fast response time (45 ms), and a superior durability (> 15000 cycles) are achieved synchronously. Here, the large linear sensing range is mainly related to the nice CB conductive network on the crosslinked PDMS foam and the high modulus and elasticity of the composite material, which ensure the homogeneous deformation of the foam under compression. It is worth noting that the response behavior of CB/PDMS foam is maintained well even in water owing to its excellent hydrophobic property (water contact angle up to 149 degrees), indicating that this material can be used as a waterproof piezoresistive sensor. Our CB/PDMS foam is then assembled as a wearable sensor, and it exhibits nice capability of monitoring human body motions, such as the bending of fingers and elbow, walking, jumping and squatting, etc. The porous foam sensor also has a good oil/water separation ability, showing a multifunctional characteristic.									120	8	0	0	16	0	123			1385-8947	1873-3212											2019-06-28	WOS:000471670400037

However, current state-of-the-art Li-based rechargeable batteries (LBRBs) use highly reactive and flowable liquid electrolytes, severely limiting their ability to meet the above requirements. Therefore, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are introduced to tackle the issues of liquid electrolytes. Nevertheless, due to their low Li+ conductivity and Li+ transference number (LITN) (around 10(-5) S cm(-1) and 0.5, respectively), SPE-based room temperature LBRBs are still in their early stages of development. This paper reviews the principles of Li+ conduction inside SPEs and the corresponding strategies to improve the Li+ conductivity and LITN of SPEs. Some representative applications of SPEs in high-energy density, safe, and flexible LBRBs are then introduced and prospected.									85	5	0	0	3	0	87				2198-3844											2021-03-03	WOS:000615818300001	33854893

To address this, a range of 1D energy harvesting and storage devices have been fabricated that show promise for such applications compared with their 2D and 3D counterparts. These 1D devices are based on fibres that are flexible and can accommodate deformation, for example, by twisting and stretching. The fibres can be woven into textiles and fabrics that breathe freely or can be integrated into different materials that fit the curved surface of the human body. In this Review, the development of fibre-based energy harvesting and storage devices is presented, focusing on dye-sensitized solar cells, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and their integrated devices. An emphasis is placed on the interface between the active materials and the electrodes or electrolyte in the 1D devices. The differing properties of these interfaces compared with those in 2D and 3D devices are derived from the curved surface and long charge transport path in 1D electrodes.									364	29	1	0	15	0	371			2058-8437												2017-06-01	WOS:000410155600002

To realize virtual reality, certain types of human-computer interaction equipment are necessary. Existing virtual reality technologies often rely on cameras, data gloves, game pads, and other equipment. These equipment are either bulky, inconvenient to carry and use, or expensive to popularize. Therefore, the development of a convenient and low-cost high-precision human-computer interaction device can contribute positively to the development of virtual reality technology. In this study, a gesture recognition wristband that can realize a full keyboard and multicommand input is developed. The wristband is convenient to wear, low in cost, and does not affect other daily operations of the hand. This wristband is based on physiological anatomy as well as aided by active sensor and machine learning technology; it can achieve a maximum accuracy of 92.6% in recognizing 26 letters. This wristband offers broad application prospects in the fields of gesture command recognition, assistive devices for the disabled, and wearable electronics.									32	1	0	0	1	0	33			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-05-06	WOS:000787794900001	35344226

When electronic devices are worn, the mechanical flexibility and/or stretchability of thin-film devices helps to minimize the stress and discomfort associated with wear because of their conformability and softness. For industrial applications, it is important to fabricate wearable devices using processing methods that maximize throughput and minimize cost. We demonstrate ultraflexible and conformable three-color, highly efficient polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and organic photodetectors (OPDs) to realize optoelectronic skins (oe-skins) that introduce multiple electronic functionalities such as sensing and displays on the surface of human skin. The total thickness of the devices, including the substrate and encapsulation layer, is only 3 mu m, which is one order of magnitude thinner than the epidermal layer of human skin. By integrating green and red PLEDs with OPDs, we fabricate an ultraflexible reflective pulse oximeter. The device unobtrusively measures the oxygen concentration of blood when laminated on a finger. On-skin seven-segment digital displays and color indicators can visualize data directly on the body.									659	34	1	0	48	0	678			2375-2548												2016-04-01	WOS:000380072100042	27152354

To streamline the diagnosis and treatment process, healthcare professionals are now adopting Internet of Things (IoT)-based wearable technology. Recent years have witnessed billions of sensors, devices, and vehicles being connected through the Internet. One such technologyremote patient monitoringis common nowadays for the treatment and care of patients. However, these technologies also pose grave privacy risks and security concerns about the data transfer and the logging of data transactions. These security and privacy problems of medical data could result from a delay in treatment progress, even endangering the patient's life. We propose the use of a blockchain to provide secure management and analysis of healthcare big data. However, blockchains are computationally expensive, demand high bandwidth and extra computational power, and are therefore not completely suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices meant for smart cities. In this work, we try to resolve the above-mentioned issues of using blockchain with IoT devices. We propose a novel framework of modified blockchain models suitable for IoT devices that rely on their distributed nature and other additional privacy and security properties of the network. These additional privacy and security properties in our model are based on advanced cryptographic primitives. The solutions given here make IoT application data and transactions more secure and anonymous over a blockchain-based network.									330	4	1	1	11	1	336				1424-8220											2019-02-27	WOS:000458569300109	30650612

The electrode exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 2426 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and ultrahigh rate capability with 72.5% capacitance retention at 20 A g(-1), as well as excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 91.6% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the FeCo2O4@NiCo-LDH/CC as the positive electrode, active carbon as the negative electrode, and PVA-KOH gel as both the solid state electrolyte and separator were assembled into flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor. The resulting FeCo2O4@NiCo-LDH//AC ASC device exhibits a maximum energy density of 94.9 Wh kg(-1), and a favorable energy density of 66.5 Wh kg(-1) is still achieved at a high power density of 1.6 kW kg(-1), as well as excellent cycling stability of 88.2% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the ASC device exhibits outstanding flexible and reliability with no degradation under large twisting, which can light one red LED indicators efficiently. The work presented herein hold promise in energy storage for future portable and wearable electronic devices.									310	11	0	0	31	0	314			1385-8947	1873-3212											2018-12-28	WOS:000418533400156

Herein, a vacuum-assisted layer-by-layer assembly technique is demonstrated to conformally deposit electrically conductive substances on textiles for developing multifunctional and flexible textiles with superb electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performances, superhydrophobicity, and highly sensitive humidity response. The formed leaf-like nanostructure is composed of silver nanowires (AgNWs) as the highly conductive skeleton (vein) and transition metal carbide/carbonitride (MXene) nanosheets as the lamina. The presence of MXene protects AgNWs from oxidation and enhances the combination of AgNWs with the fabric substrate, and the transformation of its functional groups leads to self-derived hydrophobicity. The flexible and multifunctional textile exhibits a low sheet resistance of 0.8 omega sq(-1), outstanding EMI shielding efficiency of 54 dB in the X-band at a small thickness of 120 mu m, and highly sensitive humidity responses, while retaining its satisfactory porosity and permeability. The self-derived hydrophobicity with a large contact angle of >140 degrees is achieved by aging the hydrophilic MXene coated silk. The wearable multifunctional textiles are highly promising for applications in intelligent garments, humidity sensors, actuators, and EMI shielding.									376	30	0	0	27	0	379			1616-301X	1616-3028											2019-09-19	WOS:000484598600001

The preparation of charge transporting layers at low temperature has been essential for high-performance and flexible PSCs. Recently, low-temperature-processed metal oxides have been a desirable material for charge transport and air stability for PSCs, instead of organic semiconductors. However, pristine metal oxides fabricated at low temperature have still precluded high performance of the device because of their low conductivity and large deviation in energy levels from the conduction band or valance band of the perovskite. Therefore, doping metals in the metal oxides has been considered as an effective method to endow suitable electrical properties. Herein, we developed a highly efficient electron transporting layer (ETL) comprising Li-doped SnO2 (Li:SnO2) prepared at low temperature in solution. The doped Li in SnO2 enhanced conductivity as well as induced a downward shift of the conduction band minimum of SnO2, which facilitated injection and transfer of electrons from the conduction band of the perovskite. The PCE was measured to be 18.2% and 14.78% for the rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. The high-performance and flexible PSCs could be potentially used as a wearable energy power source.

Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparameters' influence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation.									1259	37	1	0	56	0	1302				1424-8220											2016-01-01	WOS:000370679800049	26797612

However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs. Among various approaches to improve the output and sensing performance, such as material modification, structural design, and environmental management, a 3D fabric structural scheme is a facile, efficient, controllable, and scalable strategy to increase the effective contact area for contact electrification of textile TENGs without cumbersome material processing and service area restrictions. Herein, the recent advances of the current reported textile TENGs with 3D fabric structures are comprehensively summarized and systematically analyzed in order to clarify their superiorities over 1D fiber and 2D fabric structures in terms of power output and pressure sensing. The forward-looking integration abilities of the 3D fabrics are also discussed at the end. It is believed that the overview and analysis of textile TENGs with distinctive 3D fabric structures will contribute to the development and realization of high-power output micro/nanowearable power sources and high-quality self-powered wearable sensors.									58	1	0	0	5	0	57			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-04-13	WOS:000775784500001	35083786

In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives. Here, a versatile laser-induced graphene (LIG)-based integrated flexible sensor system, which can wirelessly monitor the sleeping postures, respiration rate, and diaper moisture with feedback alarm notifications, is reported. A tilt sensor based on confining a liquid metal droplet inside a cavity can track at least 18 slanting orientations. A rapid and scalable laser direct writing method realizes LIG patterning in both the in-plane and out-of-plane configurations as well as the formation of nonstick conductive structures to the liquid metal. By rationally merging the LIG-based tilt, strain, and humidity sensors on a thin flexible film, the multimodal sensor device is applied to a diaper as a real-time feedback tracking system of the sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. User-friendly interfaces, which incorporate alarming functions, provide timely feedback for caregivers tending to vulnerable populations with limited self-care capabilities.									77	6	0	0	6	0	77			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-04-01	WOS:000633510300001	33772894

A WBAN connects distributed nodes throughout the human body, which can be placed on the skin, under the skin, or on clothing and can use the human body's electromagnetic waves. An approach to reduce the size of different telecommunication equipment is constantly being sought; this allows these devices to be closer to the body or even glued and embedded within the skin without making the user feel uncomfortable or posing as a danger for the user. These networks promise new medical applications; however, these are always based on the freedom of movement and the comfort they offer. Among the advantages of these networks is that they can significantly increase user's quality of life. For example, a person can carry a WBAN with built-in sensors that calculate the user's heart rate at any given time and send these data over the internet to user's doctor. This study provides a systematic review of WBAN, describing the applications and trends that have been developed with this type of network and, in addition, the protocols and standards that must be considered.									43	0	0	0	3	0	43			1748-670X	1748-6718											2021-06-04	WOS:000651461700002	33986824

However, the rigid and fragile nature of conducting polymers hinders the long-time stability of the hydrogels and limits their applications in emerging flexible electronic devices. In this work, we have developed a novel type of multifunctional conductive polymer hydrogel, of which high conductivity is integrated with excellent stretchability, injectability, and rapid self-healing capability, by incorporating multiple hydrogen-bonding 2-ureido-4[11-1]-pyrimidinone (UPy) groups as cross-linking points into a brittle polyaniline/poly(4styrenesulfonate) (PANI/PSS) network. The formation of the interpenetrating PANI/PSS network offers the hydrogel electronic conduction assisted by ionic transport, showing a conductivity of 13 S/m and a linear response (gauge factor = 3.4) to external strain (approximate to 300%), with accurate and reliable detection of various human motions. Taking advantage of the reversibility of the noncovalent cross-links, the hydrogels can be facilely molded into different shapes and demonstrate a complete self healing within 30 s upon damage. The combination of supramolecular chemistry with conducting polymers enables multifunctionalities in the conductive hydrogel, providing new insights into the design of advanced functional materials with applications in 3D printing, wearable devices, and flexible electronics.									261	14	0	0	54	0	266			0897-4756	1520-5002											2019-07-12	WOS:000473248400024

However, the integration of multiple functions into one device remains challenging. Here, the construction of a highly stretchable and real-time omni-healable supercapacitor is demonstrated by sandwiching the polypyrrole-incorporated gold nanoparticle/carbon nanotube (CNT)/poly(acrylamide) (GCP@PPy) hydrogel electrodes with a CNT-free GCP (GP) hydrogel as the electrolyte and chemically soldering an Ag nanowire film to the hydrogel electrode as the current collector. The newly developed dynamic metal-thiolate (M-SR, M = Au, Ag) bond-induced integrated configuration, with an intrinsically powerful electrode and electrolyte, enables the assembled supercapacitor to deliver an areal capacitance of 885 mF cm(-2) and an energy density of 123 mu Wh cm(-2), which are among the highest-reported values for stretchable supercapacitors. Notably, the device exhibits a superhigh stretching strain of 800%, rapid optical healing capability, and significant real-time healability during the charge-discharge process. The exceptional performance combined with the facile assembly method confirms this multifunctional device as the best performer among all the flexible supercapacitors reported to date.									220	15	0	0	19	0	225			0935-9648	1521-4095											2019-06-14	WOS:000469243400020	30920707

However, it is still difficult to integrate excellent mechanical properties and high conductivity into one hydrogel sample simultaneously. This work introduced NaCl into a poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(acrylic amide) (PVA/PAM) double network hydrogel to prepare PVA/PAM/NaCl supramolecular hydrogel electrolytes via a one-pot method. NaCl introduces physical entanglement into the PVA/PAM/NaCl hydrogel electrolytes and provides a dense and wrinkled three dimensional (3D) network nanostructure. The PVA/PAM/NaCl hydrogel electrolytes not only showed excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength up to 477 kPa, elongation at break to 1072% and a fracture energy of 2.484 MJ m(-3)), but also had high conductivity (up to 6.23 S m(-1)). A strain sensor based on the PVA/PAM/NaCl hydrogel electrolytes exhibited very high sensitivity (gauge factor = 24.901) with the ability of precise and reliable detection of human motions. Hydrogels also showed excellent anti-freezing properties and maintained excellent mechanical properties and conductivity at -20 degrees C. Introducing a physically cross-linking network through the effects of a metal salt could promote the performance of the hydrogels. This work provides a new insight into the design of multifunctional materials with applications on electronic skin, wearable devices and biosensors.									146	5	0	0	25	0	148			2050-7488	2050-7496											2020-04-14	WOS:000526953200032

Both sensors are based on conductive poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) polymer. The highly sensitive strain sensor consists of a microfluidic channel filled with PEDOT:PSS in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The strain sensor shows 3 order (similar to 1250) increase in the resistance for 10% strain and considerably high gauge factor (GF) of similar to 12 500. The sensor was tested for similar to 30% strain, which is more than typical stretching of human skin or body parts such as chest expansion during respiration. The strain sensor was also tested for different bending and the electrical resolution was similar to 150% per degree of free bending and similar to 12k% per percentage of stretching. The resistive temperature sensor, fabricated on a Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) substrate, showed a similar to 60% decrease in resistance when the temperature changed from 25 degrees C to 85 degrees C and a sensitivity of similar to 1% per degrees C. As a proof of concept, the sensors and NFC tag were integrated on wound dressing to obtain wearable systems with smart bandage form factor. The sensors can be operated and read from distance of 25 mm with a user-friendly smartphone application developed for powering the system as well as real-time acquisition of sensors data. Finally, we demonstrate the potential use of smart bandage in healthcare applications such as assessment of wound status or respiratory diseases, such as asthma and COVID-19, where monitoring via wearable strain (e.g., respiratory volume) and temperature sensors is critical.									76	1	0	0	5	0	77			2327-4662												2021-04-19	WOS:000626569700077

Despite many years of effort, it still remains a great challenge to develop self-powered sensing systems without external power supplies. Herein, we develop a neuron-like MXene Nb2CTx/sodium alginate (Nb2CTx/SA) composite films prepared by an electrospinning approach. The Nb2CTx/SA composite film not only can be used to fabricate a highperformance electronic humidity sensor, but also to construct a moisture-triggered nanogenerator with a sustainable voltage output. Importantly, the humidity sensor is demonstrated to be portable and compatible for applications in respiration assessment, noncontact monitoring and intelligent alarm. More importantly, by simply integrating the Nb2CTx/SA film-based sensor/nanogenerator with a capacitor and light-emitting diode (LED), a prototype of self-powered sensing system capable of indicating different relative humidity (i.e., low, medium or high) through the LED's brightness without external power supplies is demonstrated. This work not only demonstrates the design and fabrication of a smart self-powered humidity sensing system, but also opens a new avenue for development of next-generation intelligent wearable electronics.									46	2	0	0	3	0	47			1385-8947	1873-3212											2022-04-27	WOS:000779663100003

The MWCNT/TPU fiber showed the highest tensile strength and ultra-high sensitivity with a gauge factor (GF) of approximately 2800 in the strain range of 5-100%. Due to its high strain sensitivity of conductivity, this CNT-reinforced composite fiber was able to be used to monitor the weight and shape of an object based on the 2D mapping of resistance changes. Moreover, the composite fiber was able to be stitched onto a highly stretchable elastic bandage using a sewing machine to produce a wearable strain sensor for the detection of diverse human motions. We also demonstrated the detection of finger motion by fabricating a smart glove at the joints. Due to its scalable production process, high stretchability and ultrasensitivity, the MWCNT/TPU fiber may open a new avenue for the fabrication of next-generation stretchable textile-based strain sensors.									124	5	0	0	4	0	125			2040-3364	2040-3372											2019-04-07	WOS:000464518400008	30869716

Skin-conformable sensors and a stretchable display are critical for the development of standalone SHPs that provide real-time information while alleviating privacy concerns related to wireless data transmission. However, the production of stretchable wearable displays with sufficient pixels to display this information remains challenging. Here, we report a standalone organic SHP that provides real-time heart rate information. The 15-mu m-thick SHP comprises a stretchable organic light-emitting diode display and stretchable organic photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor on all-elastomer substrate and operates stably under 30% strain using a combination of stress relief layers and deformable micro-cracked interconnects that reduce the mechanical stress on the active optoelectronic components. This approach provides a rational strategy for high-resolution stretchable displays, enabling the production of ideal platforms for next-generation wearable health care electronics.									77	2	0	0	3	0	78			2375-2548												2021-06-16	WOS:000658757100037	34088675	
J	Lan, Lingyi; Le, Xianhao; Dong, Hanyong; Xie, Jin; Ying, Yibin; Ping, Jianfeng								One-step and large-scale fabrication of flexible and wearable humidity sensor based on laser-induced graphene for real-time tracking of plant transpiration at bio-interface								BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS				165						112360			10.1016/j.bios.2020.112360							Article	OCT 1 2020	2020	The rapidly growing demand for humidity sensing in various applications such as noninvasive epidermal sensing, water status tracking of plants, and environmental monitoring has triggered the development of high-performance humidity sensors. In particular, timely communication with plants to understand their physiolog-ical status may facilitate preventing negative influence of environmental stress and enhancing agricultural output. In addition, precise humidity sensing at bio-interface requires the sensor to be both flexible and stable. However, challenges still exist for the realization of efficient and large-scale production of flexible humidity sensors for bio-interface applications. Here, a convenient, effective, and robust method for massive production of flexible and wearable humidity sensor is proposed, using laser direct writing technology to produce laser-induced graphene interdigital electrode (LIG-IDE). Compared to previous methods, this strategy abandons the complicated and costly procedures for traditional IDE preparation. Using graphene oxide (GO) as the humidity-sensitive material, a flexible capacitive-type GO-based humidity sensor with low hysteresis, high sensitivity (3215.25 pF/ % RH), and long-term stability (variation less than +/- 1%) is obtained. These superior properties enable the sensor with multifunctional applications such as noncontact humidity sensing and human breath monitoring. In addition, this flexible humidity sensor can be directly attached onto the plant leaves for real-time and long-term tracking transpiration from the stomata, without causing any damage to plants, making it a promising candidate for next-generation electronics for intelligent agriculture.									112	8	0	0	9	0	112			0956-5663	1873-4235											2020-09-18	WOS:000566442000003	32729493

The reduction in power levels consumed by sensors and electronic circuits accompanied by the advances in energy harvesting methods allows for the realization of self-powered monitoring systems that do not have to rely on batteries. For wearable electronics, thermoelectric generators (TEGs) offer the unique ability to continuously convert body heat into usable energy. For body harvesting, it is preferable to have TEGs that are thin, soft and flexible. Unfortunately, the performances of flexible modules reported to date have been far behind those of their rigid counterparts. This is largely due to lower efficiencies of the thermoelectric materials, electrical or thermal parasitic losses and limitations on leg dimensions posed by the synthesis techniques. In this work, we present an entirely new approach and explore the possibility of using standard bulk legs in a flexible package. Bulk thermoelectric legs cut from solid ingots are far superior to thermoelectric materials synthesized using other techniques. A key enabler of the proposed technology is the use of EGaln liquid metal interconnects, which not only provide extremely low interconnect resistance but also stretchability with self-healing, both of which are essential for flexible TE modules. The results suggest that this novel approach can finally produce flexible TEGs that have the potential to challenge the rigid TEGs and provide a pathway for the realization of self-powered wearable electronics.

Their ability to be fabricated on flexible substrates, or as fibers, also makes them attractive as passive energy harvesters in wearable devices and textiles. Cosensitization has emerged as a method that affords efficiency gains in DSCs, being most celebrated via its role in nudging power conversion efficiencies of DSCs to reach world-record values; yet, cosensitization has a much wider potential for applications, as this review will show. Cosensitization is a chemical fabrication method that produces DSC working electrodes that contain two or more different dyes with complementary optical absorption characteristics. Dye combinations that collectively afford a panchromatic absorption spectrum emulating that of the solar emission spectrum are ideal, given that such combinations use all available sunlight. This review classifies existing cosensitization efforts into seven distinct ways that dyes have been combined in order to generate panchromatic DSCs. Seven cognate molecular-engineering strategies for cosensitization are thereby developed, which tailor optical absorption toward optimal DSC-device function.									142	5	1	0	7	0	143			0009-2665	1520-6890											2019-07-12	WOS:000473251600008	31013076

Increasing network depth or width can further improve accuracy. However, in order to obtain the optimal HAR performance on mobile platform, it has to consider a reasonable tradeoff between recognition accuracy and resource consumption. Improving the performance of CNNs without increasing memory and computational burden is more beneficial for HAR. In this article, we first propose a new CNN that uses hierarchical-split (HS) idea for a large variety of HAR tasks, which is able to enhance multiscale feature representation ability via capturing a wider range of receptive fields of human activities within one feature layer. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed HS module is an impressive alternative to baseline models with similar model complexity, and can achieve higher recognition performance (e.g., 97.28%, 93.75%, 99.02%, and 79.02% classification accuracies) on UCI-HAR, PAMAP2, WISDM, and UNIMIB-SHAR. Extensive ablation studies are performed to evaluate the effect of the variations of receptive fields on classification performance. Finally, we demonstrate that multiscale receptive fields can help to learn more discriminative features (achieving 94.10% SOTA accuracy) in weakly labeled HAR dataset.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			0278-0046	1557-9948											2022-10-17	WOS:000865104500099

The specific capacitance of the FeCo2S4/RGOF electrode reaches 2487.97 F g(-1) at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) while maintaining superior stability with 95.9% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, thereby surpassing that of previously reported Fe-Co bimetallic sulfides. This is ascribed to the synergistic effect between conductive RGOF and active FeCO2S4, which are rich in redox reactions. The fabricated FeCo2S4/RGOF is utilized as a positive electrode in an asymmetric supercapacitor, delivering a high energy density of 88.2 W h kg(-1) at 800 W kg(-1).

For these emerging applications, stretchability, remoteness, stress distribution, a multimodal nature, and biocompatibility are important performance characteristics of stress sensors. Mechanoluminescence (ML)-based stress sensing has attracted widespread attention because of its characteristics of remoteness and having a distributed response to mechanical stimuli as well as its great potential for stretchability, biocompatibility, and self-powering. In the past few decades, great progress has been made in the discovery of ML materials, analysis of mechanisms, design of devices, and exploration of applications. One can find that with this progress, the focus of ML research has shifted from the phenomenon in the earliest stage to materials and recently toward devices. At the present stage, while showing great prospects for advanced stress sensing applications, ML-based sensing still faces major challenges in material optimization, device design, and system integration.									100	8	0	0	5	0	103			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-04-24	WOS:000634975800001	33786872

Thermal energy is also an abundant low-flux source that can be harnessed to power portable/wearable electronic devices and critical components in remote off-grid locations. As such, a number of different inorganic and organic materials are being explored for their potential in thermoelectric-energy-harvesting devices. Carbon-based thermoelectric materials are particularly attractive due to their use of nontoxic, abundant source-materials, their amenability to high-throughput solution-phase fabrication routes, and the high specific energy (i.e., W g(-1)) enabled by their low mass. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) represent a unique 1D carbon allotrope with structural, electrical, and thermal properties that enable efficient thermoelectric-energy conversion. Here, the progress made toward understanding the fundamental thermoelectric properties of SWCNTs, nanotube-based composites, and thermoelectric devices prepared from these materials is reviewed in detail. This progress illuminates the tremendous potential that carbon-nanotube-based materials and composites have for producing high-performance next-generation devices for thermoelectric-energy harvesting.									412	15	2	0	27	0	415			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-03-15	WOS:000427111300030	29356158

For data collection, MCS systems rely on contribution from mobile devices of a large number of participants or a crowd. Smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices are deployed widely and already equipped with a rich set of sensors, making them an excellent source of information. Mobility and intelligence of humans guarantee higher coverage and better context awareness if compared to traditional sensor networks. At the same time, individuals may be reluctant to share data for privacy concerns. For this reason, MCS frameworks are specifically designed to include incentive mechanisms and address privacy concerns. Despite the growing interest in the research community, MCS solutions need a deeper investigation and categorization on many aspects that span from sensing and communication to system management and data storage. In this paper, we take the research on MCS a step further by presenting a survey on existing works in the domain and propose a detailed taxonomy to shed light on the current landscape and classify applications, methodologies, and architectures. Our objective is not only to analyze and consolidate past research but also to outline potential future research directions and synergies with other research areas.									220	4	0	0	2	1	224				1553-877X											2019-01-01	WOS:000483018200013

An increase in the amount of crystalline beta-phase of PVDF-HFP has been observed with the increase in Co-doped ZnO nanofiller concentration in the PVDF-HFP matrix. The dielectric constants of the neat PVDF-HFP and PVDF-HFP/2 wt.% Co-ZnO nanofibers are derived as 8 and 38 respectively. The flexible nanogenerator manipulated from the polymer nanocomposite (PVDF-HFP/Co-ZnO) exhibits an output voltage as high as 2.8 V compared with the neat PVDF-HFP sample (-120 mV). These results indicate that the investigated nanocomposite is appropriate for fabricating various flexible and wearable self-powered electrical devices and systems.									184	3	0	0	10	0	185			2045-2322												2018-12-28	WOS:000422637200013	29335498

Cortisol, a clinically confirmed stress hormone related to depression and anxiety, affects individuals mentally and physically. However, current cortisol monitoring methods require expert personnel, large and complex machines, and long time for data analysis. Here, we present a flexible and wearable cortisol aptasensor for simple and rapid cortisol real-time monitoring. The sensing channel was produced by electrospinning conducting polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (NFs) and subsequent vapor deposition of carboxylated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The conjugation of the cortisol aptamer on the PEDOT-PAN NFs provided the critical sensing mechanism for the target molecule. The sensing test was performed with a liquid-ion gated field-effect transistor (FET) on a polyester (polyethylene terepthalate). The sensor performance showed a detection limit of 10 pM (<5 s) and high selectivity in the presence of interference materials at 100 times higher concentrations. The practical usage and real-time monitoring of the cortisol aptasensor with a liquid-ion gated FET system was demonstrated by successful transfer to the swab and the skin. In addition, the real-time monitoring of actual sweat by applying the cortisol aptasensor was also successful since the aptasensor was able to detect cortisol approximately 1 nM from actual sweat in a few minutes. This wearable biosensor platform supports the possibility of further application and on-site monitoring for changes of other numerous biomarkers.									25	2	0	0	1	0	25			2379-3694												2022-01-20	WOS:000742771900001	34995062

Almost all self-healing electronic skins are composed of airtight elastomers or hydrogels, which will cause skin inflammation. Fibrous membranes are ideal materials for preparing highly sensitive breathable electronic skins. However, the development of intrinsically self-healing fibrous membranes with high stability is still a challenge. Here, a novel interface protective strategy is reported to develop intrinsically self-healing fibrous membranes with a bionic confined structure for the first time, which were further assembled into an all-fiber structured electronic skin through interfacial hydrogen bonding. The electronic skin is multifunctional with self-powering, self-healing, breathability, stretchability, and thermochromism functionalities, which is highly promising for application in intelligent wearable sensing systems.									51	2	0	0	6	0	51			1433-7851	1521-3773											2022-03-18	WOS:000767122700001	35212123

However, since the reliability and stability of supercapacitors are generally destroyed by mechanical deformation and damage during practical applications, the stretchability and self-healability must be exploited for the supercapacitors. Preparing the highly stretchable and self-healable electrodes is still a challenge. Here, we report reduced graphene oxide fiber based springs as electrodes for stretchable and self-healable supercapacitors. The fiber springs (diameters of 295 gm) are thick enough to reconnect the broken electrodes accurately by visual inspection. By wrapping fiber springs with a self-healing polymer outer shell, a stretchable and self-healable supercapacitor is successfully realized. The supercapacitor has 82.4% capacitance retention after a large stretch (100%), and 54.2% capacitance retention after the third healing. This work gave an essential strategy for designing and fabricating stretchable and self-healable supercapacitors in next-generation multifunctional electronic devices.									366	24	0	0	17	0	373			1936-0851	1936-086X											2017-02-01	WOS:000395357300102	28112894

This emerging class of electronics is motivated, in part, by the new opportunities that arise from devices that have mechanical properties similar to those encountered in the human experience, such as skin, tissue, textiles, and clothing. These types of electronics (e.g., wearable or implantable electronics, sensors for soft robotics, e-skin) must operate during deformation. Liquid metals are compelling materials for these applications because, in principle, they are infinitely deformable while retaining metallic conductivity. Liquid metals have been used for stretchable wires and interconnects, reconfigurable antennas, soft sensors, self-healing circuits, and conformal electrodes. In contrast to Hg, liquid metals based on gallium have low toxicity and essentially no vapor pressure and are therefore considered safe to handle. Whereas most liquids bead up to minimize surface energy, the presence of a surface oxide on these metals makes it possible to pattern them into useful shapes using a variety of techniques, including fluidic injection and 3D printing. In addition to forming excellent conductors, these metals can be used actively to form memory devices, sensors, and diodes that are completely built from soft materials. The properties of these materials, their applications within soft and stretchable electronics, and future opportunities and challenges are considered.									956	32	1	0	60	0	969			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-07-19	WOS:000405410700006	28417536

Herein, through the combination of strain engineering and modulation of the interlayer spacing, freestanding and lightweight MXene/bacterial cellulose (BC) composite papers with excellent mechanical stability and a high electrochemical performance are first designed and prepared via a facile all-solution-based paper-making process. Following a simple laser-cutting kirigami patterning process, bendable, twistable, and stretchable all-solid-state micro-supercapacitor arrays (MSCAs) are further fabricated. As expected, benefiting from the high-performance MXene/BC composite electrodes and rational sectional structural design, the resulting kirigami MSCAs exhibit a high areal capacitance of 111.5 mF cm(-2), and are stable upon stretching of up to 100% elongation, and in bent or twisted states. The demonstrated combination of an all-solution-based MXene/BC composite paper-making method and an easily manipulated laser-cutting kirigami patterning technique enables the fabrication of MXene-based deformable all-solid-state planar MSCAs in a simple and efficient manner while achieving excellent areal performance metrics and high stretchability, making them promising micropower sources that are compatible with flexible/wearable microelectronics.									186	9	0	0	13	0	188				2198-3844											2019-08-13	WOS:000477708000004	31380175

However, for most ternary OSCs, the voltage loss (V-loss) lies between those of the two binary devices, which inevitably limits the further efficiency improvements. Herein, a non-fullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl, possessing complementary absorption spectra and forming a cascade LUMO energy level alignment with the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, was introduced as a third component to fabricate ternary OSCs. Compared to the binary blends, the ternary system exhibits reduced density of trap states, improved molecular ordering, and suppressed non-radiative recombination, and thereby yields an obviously lower V-loss than either of the binary OSCs. As a result, high efficiencies of 18.69% (certified as 18.2%) and 16.07% are obtained for the rigid and flexible OSCs, respectively. This work highlights the importance of suppressing non-radiative recombination in OSCs by using a ternary strategy and expands an effective avenue for the realization of efficient wearable electronics as novel photovoltaic power sources.									47	3	0	0	1	0	46			1754-5692	1754-5706											2022-03-04	WOS:000759749300001

Both elasticity and self-healing are important qualities for substrate materials as they comprise the majority of device components. However, most autonomous self-healing materials reported to date have poor elastic properties, i.e., they possess only modest mechanical strength and recoverability. Here, a substrate material designed is reported based on a combination of dynamic metal-coordinated bonds (beta-diketone-europium interaction) and hydrogen bonds together in a multiphase separated network. Importantly, this material is able to undergo self-healing and exhibits excellent elasticity. The polymer network forms a microphase-separated structure and exhibits a high stress at break (approximate to 1.8 MPa) and high fracture strain (approximate to 900%). Additionally, it is observed that the substrate can achieve up to 98% self-healing efficiency after 48 h at 25 degrees C, without the need of any external stimuli. A stretchable and self-healable dielectric layer is fabricated with a dual-dynamic bonding polymer system and self-healable conductive layers are created using polymer as a matrix for a silver composite. These materials are employed to prepare capacitive sensors to demonstrate a stretchable and self-healable touch pad.									237	12	0	0	15	0	239			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-12-28	WOS:000441411500017	29978512

This paper presents a comprehensive review of piezoelectric energy-harvesting techniques developed in the last decade. The piezoelectric effect has been widely adopted to convert mechanical energy to electricity, due to its high energy conversion efficiency, ease of implementation, and miniaturization. From the viewpoint of applications, we are most concerned about whether an energy harvester can generate sufficient power under a variable excitation. Therefore, here we concentrate on methodologies leading to high power output and broad operational bandwidth. Different designs, nonlinear methods, optimization techniques, and harvesting materials are reviewed and discussed in depth. Furthermore, we identify four promising applications: shoes, pacemakers, tire pressure monitoring systems, and bridge and building monitoring. We review new high-performance energy harvesters proposed for each application.									602	25	0	0	11	0	618			2542-4351												2018-04-18	WOS:000435091900012

However, it is still a huge challenge to obtain high-performance pressure sensors with high sensitivity, wide response range, and low detection limit simultaneously. Here, a polyimide (PI)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite aerogel with the merits of superelastic, high porosity, robust, and high-temperature resistance was successfully prepared through the freeze drying plus thermal imidization process. Benefiting from the strong chemical interactions between PI and CNT and stable electrical property, the composite aerogel exhibits versatile and superior brilliant sensing performance, which includes wide sensing range (80% strain, 61 kPa), ultrahigh sensitivity (11.28 kPa(-1)), ultralow detection limit (0.1% strain, <10 Pa), fast response time (50 ms) and recovery time (70 ms), remarkable long-term stability (1000 cycles), and exceptional detection ability toward different deformations (compression, distortion, and bending). Furthermore, the composite aerogel also shows stable sensing performance after annealing under different high temperatures and good thermal insulation property, making it workable in various harsh environments. As a result, the composite aerogel is suitable for the full-range human motion detection (including airflow, pulse, vocal cord vibration, and human movement) and precise detection of the pressure distribution when it is assembled into E-skin, demonstrating its great potential to serve as a high-performance wearable pressure sensor.									183	12	0	0	16	0	188			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-11-13	WOS:000497263600083	31618002

Progress in nanogenerators for mechanical energy harvesting is reviewed, mainly including two key technologies: flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and flexible triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). By means of material classification, various approaches of PENGs based on ZnO nanowires, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 2D materials, and composite materials are introduced. For flexible TENG, its structural designs and factors determining its output performance are discussed, as well as its integration, fabrication and applications.

However, studies have shown that, by exploiting the shared parameters adversaries can still compromise industrial applications such as auto-driving navigation systems, medical data in wearable devices, and industrial robots' decision making. In this article, to solve this problem, we propose an efficient and privacy-enhanced federated learning (PEFL) scheme for IAI. Compared with existing solutions, PEFL is noninteractive, and can prevent private data from being leaked even if multiple entities collude with each other. Moreover, extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superiority of PEFL in terms of accuracy and efficiency.									215	7	0	0	4	0	221			1551-3203	1941-0050											2020-10-01	WOS:000545243500030

Among various candidates for the next-generation information storage technology, resistive switching memories distinguish themselves with low power consumption, excellent downscaling potential, easy 3D stacking, and high CMOS compatibility, fulfilling key requirements for high-performance data storage. Employing organic and hybrid switching media in addition allows light weight and flexible integration of molecules with tunable device performance via molecular design-cum-synthesis strategy. In this review, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the recent advances in organic and hybrid resistive switching materials and devices, with particular attention on their design principles for electronic property tuning and flexible device performance. The current challenges posed with development of organic and hybrid resistive switching materials and flexible memory devices, together with their future perspectives, are also discussed.									231	8	0	0	5	0	231			0306-0012	1460-4744											2019-04-10	WOS:000462633900014	30398508

However, the accuracy of commercial devices is largely unknown. The aim of this work is to assess the accuracy of seven commercially available wrist-worn devices in estimating heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) and to propose a wearable sensor evaluation framework. We evaluated the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn, and Samsung Gear S2. Participants wore devices while being simultaneously assessed with continuous telemetry and indirect calorimetry while sitting, walking, running, and cycling. Sixty volunteers (29 male, 31 female, age 38 +/- 11 years) of diverse age, height, weight, skin tone, and fitness level were selected. Error in HR and EE was computed for each subject/device/activity combination. Devices reported the lowest error for cycling and the highest for walking. Device error was higher for males, greater body mass index, darker skin tone, and walking. Six of the devices achieved a median error for HR below 5% during cycling. No device achieved an error in EE below 20 percent. The Apple Watch achieved the lowest overall error in both HR and EE, while the Samsung Gear S2 reported the highest. In conclusion, most wrist-worn devices adequately measure HR in laboratory-based activities, but poorly estimate EE, suggesting caution in the use of EE measurements as part of health improvement programs. We propose reference standards for the validation of consumer health devices (http://precision.stanford.edu/).									282	1	1	0	61	0	287				2075-4426											2017-06-01	WOS:000457946800001	28538708

To help address these issues, we have developed textile supercapacitors based on knitted carbon fibers and activated carbon ink. We show capacitances as high as 0.51 F cm(-2) per device at 10 mV s(-1), which is directly comparable with those of standard activated carbon film electrodes tested under the same conditions. We also demonstrate the performance of the device when bent at 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees and when stretched. This is the first report on knitting as a fabrication technique for integrated energy storage devices.									432	18	0	0	24	1	443			1754-5692												2013-09-01	WOS:000323198100019

All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust(3,4). Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors(5-8), the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers(9-11). An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods(12). Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks(13,14). Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high onfoff current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device.									872	43	0	0	52	0	882			0028-0836	1476-4687											2016-11-17	WOS:000388161700050	27853213

However, the lack of industrially weavable and knittable conductive yarns in conjunction with high capacitance, limits the wide-scale application of such textiles. Here pristine soft conductive yarns are continuously produced by a scalable method with the use of twist-bundle-drawing technique, and are mechanically robust enough to be knitted to a cloth by a commercial cloth knitting machine. Subsequently, the reduced-graphene-oxide-modified conductive yarns covered with a hierarchical structure of MnO2 nanosheets and a polypyrrole thin film were used to fabricate weavable, knittable and wearable yarn supercapacitors. The resultant modified yarns exhibit specific capacitances as high as 36.6 mF cm(-1) and 486 mF cm(-2) in aqueous electrolyte (three-electrode cell) or 31 mF cm(-1) and 411 mF cm(-2) in all solid-state two-electrode cell. The symmetric solid-state supercapacitor has high energy densities of 0.0092 min cm(-2) and 1.1 mWh cm(-3) (both normalized to the whole device) with a long cycle life. Large energy storage textiles are fabricated by weaving our flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor yarns to a 15 cm x 10 cm cloth on a loom and knitting in a woollen wrist band to form a pattern, enabling dual functionalities of energy storage capability and wearability.									373	17	0	0	16	0	378			1936-0851	1936-086X											2015-05-01	WOS:000355383000013	25842997

A flexible, transparent and super-long-life supercapacitor based on ultrafine Co3O4 nanocrystal electrodes								NANOSCALE				8	7			4227	4235				10.1039/c5nr09145d							Article	2016	2016	Flexible and transparent supercapacitors, as advanced energy storage devices, are essential for the development of innovative wearable electronics because of their unique optical and mechanical qualities. However, all previous designs are based on carbon-based nanostructures like carbon nanotubes and graphene, and these devices usually have poor or short cycling lives. Here, we demonstrate a high-performance, flexible, transparent, and super-long-life supercapacitor made from ultrafine Co3O4 nanocrystals synthesized using a novel process involving laser ablation in liquid. The fabricated flexible and transparent pseudocapacitor exhibits a high capacitance of 177 F g(-1) on a mass basis and 6.03 mF cm(-2) based on the area of the active material at a scan rate of 1 mV s(-1), as well as a super-long cycling life with 100% retention rate after 20 000 cycles. An optical transmittance of up to 51% at a wavelength of 550 nm is achieved, and there are not any obvious changes in the specific capacitance after bending from 0 degrees to 150 degrees, even after bending over 100 times. The integrated electrochemical performance of the Co3O4-based supercapacitor is greatly superior to that of the carbon-based ones reported to date. These findings open the door to applications of transition metal oxides as advanced electrode materials in flexible and transparent pseudocapacitors.									189	9	0	0	9	0	191			2040-3364	2040-3372											2016-01-01	WOS:000370761700044	26838964

The degradation is attributed to the brittleness and discrepancy of perovskite crystal growth upon different substrates. Inspired by robust crystallization and flexible structure of vertebrae, herein, we employ a conductive and glued polymer between indium tin oxide and perovskite layers, which simultaneously facilitates oriented crystallization of perovskite and sticks the devices. With the results of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, this bionic interface layer accurately controls the crystallization and acts as an adhesive. The flexible PSCs achieve the power conversion efficiencies of 19.87% and 17.55% at effective areas of 1.01 cm(2) and 31.20 cm(2) respectively, retaining over 85% of original efficiency after 7000 narrow bending cycles with negligible angular dependence. Finally, the modules are assembled into a wearable solar-power source, enabling the upscaling of flexible electronics.									128	11	0	0	0	0	134			2041-1723												2020-06-15	WOS:000558685500008	32541859

Harnessing wearable device data to improve state-level real-time surveillance of influenza-like illness in the USA: a population-based study								LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH				2	2			E85	E93				10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30222-5							Article	FEB 2020	2020	Background Acute infections can cause an individual to have an elevated resting heart rate (RHR) and change their routine daily activities due to the physiological response to the inflammatory insult. Consequently, we aimed to evaluate if population trends of seasonal respiratory infections, such as influenza, could be identified through wearable sensors that collect RHR and sleep data.Methods We obtained de-identified sensor data from 200 000 individuals who used a Fitbit wearable device from March 1, 2016, to March 1, 2018, in the USA. We included users who wore a Fitbit for at least 60 days and used the same wearable throughout the entire period, and focused on the top five states with the most Fitbit users in the dataset: California, Texas, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Inclusion criteria included having a self-reported birth year between 1930 and 2004, height greater than 1 m, and weight greater than 20 kg. We excluded daily measurements with missing RHR, missing wear time, and wear time less than 1000 min per day. We compared sensor data with weekly estimates of influenza-like illness (ILI) rates at the state level, as reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), by identifying weeks in which Fitbit users displayed elevated RHRs and increased sleep levels. For each state, we modelled ILI case counts with a negative binomial model that included 3-week lagged CDC ILI rate data (null model) and the proportion of weekly Fitbit users with elevated RHR and increased sleep duration above a specified threshold (full model). We also evaluated weekly change in ILI rate by linear regression using change in proportion of elevated Fitbit data. Pearson correlation was used to compare predicted versus CDC reported ILI rates.Findings We identified 47 249 users in the top five states who wore a Fitbit consistently during the study period, including more than 13.3 million total RHR and sleep measures. We found the Fitbit data significantly improved ILI predictions in all five states, with an average increase in Pearson correlation of 0.12 (SD 0.07) over baseline models, corresponding to an improvement of 6.3-32.9%. Correlations of the final models with the CDC ILI rates ranged from 0.84 to 0.97. Week-to-week changes in the proportion of Fitbit users with abnormal data were associated with week-to-week changes in ILI rates in most cases.Interpretation Activity and physiological trackers are increasingly used in the USA and globally to monitor individual health. By accessing these data, it could be possible to improve real-time and geographically refined influenza surveillance. This information could be vital to enact timely outbreak response measures to prevent further transmission of influenza cases during outbreaks. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

However, because such nanoscatterers require subwavelength features, the fabrication of elements that operate in the visible range is challenging. Here, we show that chiral liquid crystals(6,7) with a self-organized helical structure enable metasurface-like, non-specular reflection in the visible region. The phase of light that is Bragg-reflected off the helical structure can be controlled over 0-2 pi depending on the spatial phase of the helical structure; thus planar elements with arbitrary reflected wavefronts can be created via orientation control. The circular polarization selectivity and external field tunability of Bragg reflection open a wide variety of potential applications for this family of functional devices, from optical isolators to wearable displays.									196	13	0	0	10	0	199			1749-4885	1749-4893											2016-06-22	WOS:000377476500016

In the last few decades, most research on thermoelectrics has focused on inorganic bulk thermoelectric materials and corresponding devices, and their thermoelectric properties have been significantly improved. An emerging topic is flexible devices, where the use of bulk inorganic materials is precluded by their inherent rigidity. The purpose of this paper is to review the research progress on flexible thermoelectric materials and generators, including theoretical principles for TEGs, conducting polymer TE materials, nanocomposites comprised of inorganic nanostructures in polymer matrices and fully inorganic flexible TE materials in nanostructured thin films. Approaches for flexible TEGs and components are reviewed, and remaining challenges discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These breakthroughs have recently been used to create organic thermoelectric materials, which have potential for wearable heating and cooling devices, and near-room-temperature energy generation. So far, the best thermoelectric materials have been inorganic compounds (such as Bi2Te3) that have relatively low Earth abundance and are fabricated through highly complex vacuum processing routes. Molecular materials and hybrid organic-inorganic materials now demonstrate figures of merit approaching those of these inorganic materials, while also exhibiting unique transport behaviours that are suggestive of optimization pathways and device geometries that were not previously possible.

Here, we develop a high-performance, waterproof, tailorable, and stretchable yarn zinc ion battery (ZIB) using double-helix yarn electrodes and a cross-linked polyacrylamide (PAM) electrolyte. Due to the high ionic conductivity of the PAM electrolyte and helix structured electrodes, the yarn ZIB delivers a high specific capacity and volumetric energy density (302.1 mAh g(-1) and 53.8 mWh cm(-3), respectively) as well as excellent cycling stability (98.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles). More importantly, the quasi-solid-state yarn ZIB also demonstrates superior knittability, good stretchability (up to 300% strain), and superior waterproof capability (high capacity retention of 96.5% after 12 h underwater operation). In addition, the long yarn ZIB can be tailored into short ones, and each part still functions well. Owing to its weavable and tailorable nature, a 1.1 m long yarn ZIB was cut into eight parts and woven into a textile that was used to power a long flexible belt embedded with 100 LEDs and a 100 cm(2) flexible electroluminescent panel.									360	32	0	0	8	0	367			1936-0851	1936-086X											2018-12-28	WOS:000431088200009	29589438

Development of sophisticated stretchable circuits requires new materials with stable conductivity over large strains, and low-resistance interfaces between soft and conventional (rigid) electronic components. To address this need, we introduce biphasic Ga-In, a printable conductor with high conductivity (2.06 x 10(6) S m(-1)), extreme stretchability (>1,000%), negligible resistance change when strained, cyclic stability (consistent performance over 1,500 cycles) and a reliable interface with rigid electronics. We employ a scalable transfer-printing process to create various stretchable circuit board assemblies that maintain their performance when stretched, including a multilayer light-emitting diode display, an amplifier circuit and a signal conditioning board for wearable sensing applications. The compatibility of biphasic Ga-In with scalable manufacturing methods, robust interfaces with off-the-shelf electronic components and electrical/mechanical cyclic stability enable direct conversion of established circuit board assemblies to soft and stretchable forms.Conductors made of a mixture of liquid and solid domains of Ga-In alloy can be stretched over 1,000%, keeping almost constant conductivity, and used to connect commercial electronic components and realize stretchable multilayer printed circuit boards.									124	5	0	0	8	0	125			1476-1122	1476-4660											2021-02-18	WOS:000619416100001	33603186

Three inertial sensor units were used in this study and were worn by healthy subjects at key points of upper/lower body limbs (chest, right thigh and left ankle). Three main steps describe the activity recognition process: sensors' placement, data pre-processing and data classification. Four supervised classification techniques namely, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Random Forest (RF) as well as three unsupervised classification techniques namely, k-Means, Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), are compared in terms of correct classification rate, F-measure, recall, precision, and specificity. Raw data and extracted features are used separately as inputs of each classifier. The feature selection is performed using a wrapper approach based on the RF algorithm. Based on our experiments, the results obtained show that the k-NN classifier provides the best performance compared to other supervised classification algorithms, whereas the HMM classifier is the one that gives the best results among unsupervised classification algorithms. This comparison highlights which approach gives better performance in both supervised and unsupervised contexts. It should be noted that the obtained results are limited to the context of this study, which concerns the classification of the main daily living human activities using three wearable accelerometers placed at the chest, right shank and left ankle of the subject.									427	6	0	0	28	1	434				1424-8220											2015-12-01	WOS:000367539100094	26690450

Whereas solution-processable active materials have been widely adopted for the fabrication of organic, dye-sensitized, and perovskite solar cells, vacuum-deposited transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) such as indium tin oxide, fluorine-doped tin oxide, and aluminum-doped tin oxide are still the most frequently used transparent electrodes (TEs) for solar cells. These TCOs not only significantly increase the manufacturing cost of the device, but also are too brittle for future flexible and wearable applications. Therefore, developing solution-processed TEs for solar cells is of great interest. This paper provides a detailed discussion on the recent development of solution-processed TEs, including the chemical synthesis of the electrode materials, the solution-based technologies for the electrode fabrication, the optical and electrical properties of the solution-processed TEs, and their applications on solar cells.									112	5	0	0	4	0	113			0009-2665	1520-6890											2020-03-17	WOS:000517360300002	31961135

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising candidate materials for flexible SC electrodes because of their outstanding mechanical property, high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and functionability. CNTs can assemble into various macroscopic materials with different dimensions. In this review, flexible CNT assemblies including 1D fibers, 2D films, and 3D aerogels and sponges are introduced with a focus on the design strategies and fabrication techniques. The recent developments and state-of-the-art applications of such structures as electrodes in flexible SCs are summarized based on device configurations including sandwiched, interdigital in-plane, and cable-type configurations. The flexible CNT-based electrodes have shown great advantages in bendability, stretchability and/or compressibility, as well as a long cycle lifetime. The current challenges and future research opportunities in this field are also discussed.									91	10	0	0	2	0	92			1998-0124	1998-0000											2020-04-14	WOS:000522918200001

Here, a superhydrophobic and conductive nanofiber composites (SCNCs) with a hierarchical SiO2/graphene shell and polyurethane (PU) nanofiber core microstructure were fabricated by assembling graphene on PU nanofibers under the assistance of ultrasonication, followed by stretching-induced SiO2 nanoparticles decoration onto the graphene shell. The introduction of graphene and SiO2 nanoparticles improves both Young's modulus, tensile strength and the elongation at break of PU nanofibrous membrane. The superhydrophobicity and conductivity can be almost maintained after the SCNCs are subject to cyclic stretching or abrasion or even exposed to harsh conditions. When used as strain sensors, the SCNCs show high stretchability, reliability and good durability and can be used in harsh environment including acid and salt conditions. The SCNCs are then assembled to monitor full range body motions including both subtle and large body movements, making it a promising candidate in wearable electronics.									127	11	0	0	21	0	129			1385-8947	1873-3212											2019-06-28	WOS:000471682900027

Even though the most popular type of gas sensor, namely, resistive-based gas sensors, have many advantages over other types of gas sensors, their high working temperatures lead to high energy consumption, thereby limiting their practical applications, especially in mobile and portable devices. As possible ways to deal with the high-power consumption of resistance-based sensors, different strategies such as self-heating, MEMS technology, and room-temperature operation using especial morphologies, have been introduced in recent years. In this review, we discuss different types of energy-saving chemisresitive gas sensors including self-heated gas sensors, MEMS based gas sensors, room temperature operated flexible/wearable sensor and their application in the fields of environmental monitoring. At the end, the review will be concluded by providing a summary, challenges, recent trends, and future perspectives.									154	3	0	0	8	0	154			2211-2855	2211-3282											2021-03-14	WOS:000620324300003	32959010

Fabrication of conformable and durable textiles with high triboelectric outputs remains challenging. Here we propose a washable skintouch- actuated textile-based triboelectric nanogenerator for harvesting mechanical energy from both voluntary and involuntary body motions. Black phosphorus encapsulated with hydrophobic cellulose oleoyl ester nanoparticles serves as a synergetic electron-trapping coating, rendering a textile nanogenerator with long-term reliability and high triboelectricity regardless of various extreme deformations, severe washing, and extended environmental exposure. Considerably high output (similar to 250-880 V, similar to 0.48-1.1 mu A cm(-2)) can be attained upon touching by hand with a small force (similar to 5 N) and low frequency (similar to 4 Hz), which can power lightemitting diodes and a digital watch. This conformable all-textile-nanogenerator is incorporable onto cloths/skin to capture the low output of 60 V from subtle involuntary friction with skin, well suited for users' motion or daily operations.									325	9	0	0	17	0	325			2041-1723												2018-10-15	WOS:000447298900002	30323200

Flexible, portable, and self-powered electronic devices based on TENGs are much desired, whereas the complex preparation processes and high cost of traditional flexible electrodes hinder their practical applications. Here, an MXene/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel TENG (MH-TENG) is presented with simple fabrication, high output performance, and versatile applications. The doping of MXene nanosheets promotes the crosslinking of the PVA hydrogel and improves the stretchability of the composite hydrogel. The MXene nanosheets also form microchannels on surfaces, which not only enhances the conductivity of the hydrogel by improving the transport of ions but also generates an extra triboelectric output via a streaming vibration potential mechanism. The measured open-circuit voltage of the MH-TENG reaches up to 230 V even in a single-electrode mode. The MH-TENG can be stretched up to 200% of the original length and demonstrates a monotonical increasing relationship between the stretchable length and the short-circuit voltage. By utilizing the MH-TENG's outstanding stretchable property and ultrahigh sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, applications in wearable movement monitoring, high-precision written stroke recognition, and low-frequency mechanical energy harvesting are demonstrated.									129	4	0	0	10	0	131			1616-301X	1616-3028											2021-07-10	WOS:000669378000001

Identification of pulse irregularity or variability from these data has the potential to identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF, collectively). The rapidly expanding consumer base of these devices allows for detection of undiagnosed AF at scale.Methods The Apple Heart Study is a prospective, single arm pragmatic study that has enrolled 419,093 participants (NCT03335800). The primary objective is to measure the proportion of participants with an irregular pulse detected by the Apple Watch (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA) with AF on subsequent ambulatory ECG patch monitoring. The secondary objectives are to: 1) characterize the concordance of pulse irregularity notification episodes from the Apple Watch with simultaneously recorded ambulatory ECGs; 2) estimate the rate of initial contact with a health care provider within 3 months after notification of pulse irregularity. The study is conducted virtually, with screening, consent and data collection performed electronically from within an accompanying smartphone app. Study visits are performed by telehealth study physicians via video chat through the app, and ambulatory ECG patches are mailed to the participants.Conclusions The results of this trial will provide initial evidence for the ability of a smartwatch algorithm to identify pulse irregularity and variability which may reflect previously unknown AF. The Apple Heart Study will help provide a foundation for how wearable technology can inform the clinical approach to AF identification and screening.									197	4	1	0	44	1	202			0002-8703	1097-6744											2019-01-01	WOS:000452986300008	30392584

They are the basic building blocks of textiles. Synthetic fibers not only make clothes stronger and more durable, but are also customizable and cheaper. The growth of miniature and wearable electronics has promoted the development of smart and multifunctional fibers. Particularly, the incorporation of functional semiconductors and electroactive materials in fibers has opened up the field of fiber electronics. The energy supply system is the key branch for fiber electronics. Herein, after a brief introduction on the history of smart and functional fibers, we review the current state of advanced functional fibers for their application in energy conversion and storage, focusing on nanogenerators, solar cells, supercapacitors and batteries. Subsequently, the importance of the integration of fiber-shaped energy conversion and storage devices via smart structure design is discussed. Finally, the challenges and future direction in this field are highlighted. Through this review, we hope to inspire scientists with different research backgrounds to enter this multi-disciplinary field to promote its prosperity and development and usher in a truly new era of smart fibers.									72	5	0	0	4	0	72			0306-0012	1460-4744											2021-05-17	WOS:000645222200001	33912884

Conventional pulse sensors have the capability of detecting human biosignals, but have significant drawbacks of power consumption issues that limit sustainable operation of wearable medical devices. Here, a self-powered piezoelectric pulse sensor is demonstrated to enable in vivo measurement of radial/ carotid pulse signals in near-surface arteries. The inorganic piezoelectric sensor on an ultrathin plastic achieves conformal contact with the complex texture of the rugged skin, which allows to respond to the tiny pulse changes arising on the surface of epidermis. Experimental studies provide characteristics of the sensor with a sensitivity (approximate to 0.018 kPa(-1)), response time (approximate to 60 ms), and good mechanical stability. Wireless transmission of detected arterial pressure signals to a smart phone demonstrates the possibility of self-powered and real-time pulse monitoring system.									367	13	0	0	28	0	372			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-10-04	WOS:000412184100014	28714239

Minimal invasiveness is highly desirable when applying wearable electronics directly onto human skin. However, manufacturing such on-skin electronics on planar substrates results in limited gas permeability. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically investigate their long-term physiological and psychological effects. As a demonstration of substrate-free electronics, here we show the successful fabrication of inflammation-free, highly gas-permeable, ultrathin, lightweight and stretchable sensors that can be directly laminated onto human skin for long periods of time, realized with a conductive nanomesh structure. A one-week skin patch test revealed that the risk of inflammation caused by on-skin sensors can be significantly suppressed by using the nanomesh sensors.

In this paper, we propose a new type of stretchable strain sensor that can detect both tensile and compressive strains and can be fabricated by a very simple process. A silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) thin film patterned on the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp by a single-step direct transfer process is used as the strain sensing material. The working principle is the change in the electrical resistance caused by the opening/closure of micro-cracks under mechanical deformation. The fabricated stretchable strain sensor shows highly sensitive and durable sensing performances in various tensile/compressive strains, long-term cyclic loading and relaxation tests. We demonstrate the applications of our stretchable strain sensors such as flexible pressure sensors and wearable human motion detection devices with high sensitivity, response speed and mechanical robustness.									461	25	0	0	17	0	472			2040-3364	2040-3372											2014-01-01	WOS:000343000800043	25175360

Studies on sensing materials, which play a key role in good gas sensing performance, are currently focused extensively on semiconducting metal oxide nanostructures (SMONs) used in the conventional resistance type gas sensors. This topical review highlights the designs and mechanisms of different SMONs with various patterns (e.g. nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets, nanorods, nanotubes, nanofilms, etc.) for gas sensors to detect various hazardous gases at room temperature. The key topics include (1) single phase SMONs including both n-type and p-type ones; (2) noble metal nanoparticle and metal ion modified SMONs; (3) composite oxides of SMONs; (4) composites of SMONs with carbon nanomaterials. Enhancement of the sensing performance of SMONs at room temperature can also be realized using a photo-activation effect such as ultraviolet light. SMON based mechanically flexible and wearable room temperature gas sensors are also discussed. Various mechanisms have been discussed for the enhanced sensing performance, which include redox reactions, heterojunction generation, formation of metal sulfides and the spillover effect. Finally, major challenges and prospects for the SMON based room temperature gas sensors are highlighted.									370	21	0	0	17	0	376			2051-6347	2051-6355											2019-04-10	WOS:000462637900004

Herein, we develop a straightforward, continuously controlled, additive/binder-free method to fabricate pure MXene fibers via a large-scale wet-spinning assembly. Our MXene sheets (with an average lateral size of 5.11 mu m(2)) are highly concentrated in water and do not form aggregates or undergo phase separation. Introducing ammonium ions during the coagulation process successfully assembles MXene sheets into flexible, meter-long fibers with very high electrical conductivity (7,713Scm(-1)). The fabricated MXene fibers are comprehensively integrated by using them in electrical wires to switch on a light-emitting diode light and transmit electrical signals to earphones to demonstrate their application in electrical devices. Our wet-spinning strategy provides an approach for continuous mass production of MXene fibers for high-performance, next-generation, and wearable electronic devices. Large-scale production of fibers from two dimensional materials opens a pathway to promising applications. Here the authors report meter-long MXene fibers with high electrical conductivity that are fabricated via continuous wet spinning and demonstrated in electrical wires.									144	7	0	0	9	0	147			2041-1723												2020-06-30	WOS:000540513300018	32499504

We found that the HPC could still form cholesteric liquid-crystal photonic structures with the CNTs additive for enhancing their color saturation and PACA polymerization for locating their assembled periodic structures. As the composite hydrogel containing HPC elements and the PACA scaffold responds to different stimuli, such as temperature variations, mechanical pressure, and tension, it could correspondingly change its volume or internal nanostructure and report these as visible color switches. In addition, due to the additive of CNTs, the composite hydrogel could also output these stimuli as electrical resistance signals. Thus, the hydrogel E-skins had the ability of quantitatively feeding back external stimuli through electrical resistance as well as visually mapping the stimulating sites by color variation. This dual-signal sensing provides the ability of visible-user interaction as well as antiinterference, endowing the multifunctional E-skin with great application prospects.									124	3	0	0	12	0	125			0027-8424												2020-10-13	WOS:000573684400002	32675247

Inspired from the properties of human skin, imitating of the complicated human sensation using stretchable electronic devices becomes one of the most exciting research fields due to its vast potential application fields like wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. To mimic real human skin, the huge sensor network is required to attach the body, where it seems critical to guarantee the energy supply at the same time. Nowadays, the emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which can transduce the mechanical energy into the electrical energy based on the contact electrification and electrostatic induction, provides an attractive solution for the energy problem to work as the self-powered sensor. The self-powered sensor can generate electrical signal by it self-responsing to the stimulation from the environment without further energy supply devices. With four fundamental working modes and three main detection modes, TENG could develop versatile configurations to realize the various kinds of sensation. The mechanical compliance and stretchability together with the electrical conductance can be fulfilled beneficial from the advancement of material and micro/nano fabrication technology. In this way, the TENG based self-powered electronic skins (e-skins) have been developed with rational design to accomplish multifunctions of sensing including the pressure, position, strain, sliding and so on. It is expected that the self-powered e-skin will continue its fast development and make more progress to make the e-skin come into human life in the near future.									168	13	0	0	9	0	170			2211-2855	2211-3282											2019-01-25	WOS:000455264600026

However, it remains a big challenge to integrate multiple functions into one gel that can be widely applied in various complex scenes. Herein, a kind of multifunctional ionogels with a combination of desirable properties, including transparency, high stretchability, solvent and temperature resistance, recyclability, high conductivity, underwater self-healing ability, and underwater adhesiveness is reported. The ionogels are prepared via one-step photoinitiated polymerization of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl acrylate and acrylamide in a hydrophobic ionic liquid. The abundant noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interactions endow the ionogels with excellent mechanical strength, resilience, and rapid self-healing capability at room temperature, while the fluorine-rich polymeric matrix brings in high tolerance against water and various organic solvents, as well as tough underwater adhesion on different substrates. Wearable strain sensors based on the ionogels can sensitively detect and differentiate large body motions, such as bending of limbs, walking and jumping, as well as subtle muscle movements, such as pronunciation and pulse. It is believed that the designed ionogels will show great promises in wearable devices and ionotronics.									116	1	0	0	16	0	115			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-10-24	WOS:000706866500001	34647370

Biomimicry, by learning from nature's concepts and design principles, is driving a paradigm shift in modern materials science and technology. However, the complicated structural architectures in nature far exceed the capability of traditional design and fabrication technologies, which hinders the progress of biomimetic study and its usage in engineering systems. Additive manufacturing (three-dimensional (3D) printing) has created new opportunities for manipulating and mimicking the intrinsically multiscale, multimaterial, and multifunctional structures in nature. Here, an overview of recent developments in 3D printing of biomimetic reinforced mechanics, shape changing, and hydrodynamic structures, as well as optical and electrical devices is provided. The inspirations are from various creatures such as nacre, lobster claw, pine cone, flowers, octopus, butterfly wing, fly eye, etc., and various 3D-printing technologies are discussed.

Flexible electrodes with superior electrochemical performance are critical components for flexible energy storage devices. Herein, we propose a simple and versatile electrospinning strategy to prepare the SnS/C nanofibers (SnS/C NFs) film. By using SnS/C NFs film directly as a free-standing anode in both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), it can provide outstanding electrochemical performance. For LIBs, it delivers high capacities of 648 and 548mAh g(-1) at 200 and 500mAg(-1) respectively after 500 cycles. It even shows outstanding cyclability for 1000 cycles. For SIBs, it retains capacity of 481mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 50mAg(-1). Moreover, the capacity remains as high as 349mAh g(-1) at 200mAg(-1) after 500 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the fact that the fine SnS nanoparticles dispersed in one-dimensional porous nanofibers with uniform diameters around 130 nm shorten the transport path of ions and electrons, and the presence of N-doped carbon enhanced the electrical conductivity as well as relieve the volume change caused by the alloying/de-alloying reaction. Besides, the ultra-robust mechanical flexibility of SnS/C NFs film makes it a promising anode candidate for flexible LIB and SIB in future.									186	16	0	0	1	0	190			2405-8297												2019-02-13	WOS:000456689500001

Although there have been significant efforts to realize OVs using conventional optics, it is limited by large volume, high cost, and lack of design flexibility. Optical metasurfaces have recently attracted tremendous interest due to their unprecedented capability in the manipulation of the amplitude, phase, polarization, and frequency of light at a subwavelength scale. Optical metasurfaces have revolutionized design concepts in photonics, providing a new platform to develop ultrathin optical devices for the realization of OVs at subwavelength resolution. In this article, we will review the recent progress in optical metasurface-based OVs. We provide a comprehensive discussion on the optical manipulation of OVs, including OAM superposition, OAM sorting, OAM multiplexing, OAM holography, and nonlinear metasurfaces for OAM generation and manipulation. The rapid development of metasurface for OVs generation and manipulation will play an important role in many relevant research fields. We expect that metasurface will fuel the continuous progress of wearable and portable consumer electronics and optics where low-cost and miniaturized OAM related systems are in high demand.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			2192-8606	2192-8614											2022-01-12	WOS:000739998700001

To enable soft machines to respond intelligently to their surroundings, compliant sensory feedback mechanisms are needed. Specifically, soft alternatives to strain gauges-with high resolution at low strain (less than 5 per cent)-could unlock promising new capabilities in soft systems. However, currently available sensing mechanisms typically possess either high strain sensitivity or high mechanical resilience, but not both. The scarcity of resilient and compliant ultra-sensitive sensing mechanisms has confined their operation to laboratory settings, inhibiting their widespread deployment. Here we present a versatile and compliant transduction mechanism for high-sensitivity strain detection with high mechanical resilience, based on strain-mediated contact in anisotropically resistive structures (SCARS). The mechanism relies upon changes in Ohmic contact between stiff, micro-structured, anisotropically conductive meanders encapsulated by stretchable films. The mechanism achieves high sensitivity, with gauge factors greater than 85,000, while being adaptable for use with high-strength conductors, thus producing sensors resilient to adverse loading conditions. The sensing mechanism also exhibits high linearity, as well as insensitivity to bending and twisting deformations-features that are important for soft device applications. To demonstrate the potential impact of our technology, we construct a sensor-integrated, lightweight, textile-based arm sleeve that can recognize gestures without encumbering the hand. We demonstrate predictive tracking and classification of discrete gestures and continuous hand motions via detection of small muscle movements in the arm. The sleeve demonstration shows the potential of the SCARS technology for the development of unobtrusive, wearable biomechanical feedback systems and human-computer interfaces.									174	6	0	0	16	0	176			0028-0836	1476-4687											2020-11-25	WOS:000588830300007	33177670

We, therefore, tested the performance of many of the latest consumer sleep-tracking devices, alongside actigraphy, versus the gold-standard sleep assessment technique, polysomnography (PSG).Methods: In total, 34 healthy young adults (22 women; 28.1 +/- 3.9 years, mean +/- SD) were tested on three consecutive nights (including a disrupted sleep condition) in a sleep laboratory with PSG, along with actigraphy (Philips Respironics Actiwatch 2) and a subset of consumer sleep-tracking devices. Altogether, four wearable (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, Garmin Fenix SS, Garmin Vivosmart 3) and three nonwearable (EarlySense Live, ResMed S+, SleepScore Max) devices were tested. Sleep/wake summary and epoch-by-epoch agreement measures were compared with PSG.Results: Most devices (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, EarlySense Live, ResMed Si-, SleepScore Max) performed as well as or better than actigraphy on sleep/wake performance measures, while the Garmin devices performed worse. Overall, epoch-by-epoch sensitivity was high (all >= 0.93), specificity was low-to-medium (0.18-034), sleep stage comparisons were mixed, and devices tended to perform worse on nights with poorer/disrupted sleep.Conclusions: Consumer sleep-tracking devices exhibited high performance in detecting sleep, and most performed equivalent to (or better than) actigraphy in detecting wake. Device sleep stage assessments were inconsistent. Findings indicate that many newer sleep-tracking devices demonstrate promising performance for tracking sleep and wake. Devices should be tested in different populations and settings to further examine their wider validity and utility.									68	2	0	0	19	1	70			0161-8105	1550-9109											2021-05-01	WOS:000656142100021	33378539	
J	Papa, Armando; Mital, Monika; Pisano, Paola; Del Giudice, Manlio								E-health and wellbeing monitoring using smart healthcare devices: An empirical investigation								TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE				153						119226			10.1016/j.techfore.2018.02.018							Article	APR 2020	2020	According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 3 (SDG - Goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devices-seems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS - SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices.									125	0	0	0	4	0	125			0040-1625	1873-5509											2020-05-01	WOS:000527366500002

Recent advances in sweat collection and sensing technologies offer powerful capabilities, but they are not effective for use in extreme situations such as aquatic or arid environments, because of unique challenges in eliminating interference/contamination from surrounding water, maintaining robust adhesion in the presence of viscous drag forces and/or vigorous motion, and preventing evaporation of collected sweat. This paper introduces materials and designs for waterproof, epidermal, microfluidic and electronic systems that adhere to the skin to enable capture, storage, and analysis of sweat, even while fully underwater. Field trials demonstrate the ability of these devices to collect quantitative in situ measurements of local sweat chloride concentration, local sweat loss (and sweat rate), and skin temperature during vigorous physical activity in controlled, indoor conditions and in open-ocean swimming.									167	9	0	0	33	0	169			2375-2548												2019-02-15	WOS:000457547900072	30746456

Sampling human sweat, which is rich in physiological information(13), could enable non-invasive monitoring. Previously reported sweat-based and other non-invasive biosensors either can only monitor a single analyte at a time or lack on-site signal processing circuitry and sensor calibration mechanisms for accurate analysis of the physiological state(14-18). Given the complexity of sweat secretion, simultaneous and multiplexed screening of target biomarkers is critical and requires full system integration to ensure the accuracy of measurements. Here we present a mechanically flexible and fully integrated (that is, no external analysis is needed) sensor array for multiplexed in situ perspiration analysis, which simultaneously and selectively measures sweat metabolites (such as glucose and lactate) and electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium ions), as well as the skin temperature (to calibrate the response of the sensors). Our work bridges the technological gap between signal transduction, conditioning (amplification and filtering), processing and wireless transmission in wearable biosensors by merging plastic-based sensors that interface with the skin with silicon integrated circuits consolidated on a flexible circuit board for complex signal processing. This application could not have been realized using either of these technologies alone owing to their respective inherent limitations. The wearable system is used to measure the detailed sweat profile of human subjects engaged in prolonged indoor and outdoor physical activities, and to make a real-time assessment of the physiological state of the subjects. This platform enables a wide range of personalized diagnostic and physiological monitoring applications.									2756	111	2	0	435	1	2838			0028-0836	1476-4687											2016-01-28	WOS:000368673800033	26819044

Dispersing nanomaterial can minimize the exergy loss. The modeling outputs were depicted in terms of 3D plots and contours. Because of reduction of irreversibility with inclusion of nanoparticles, hybrid nanofluid was employed. Increasing Ha results in greater X-d and it is more sensible when convection become stronger. The growth of permeability increases nanomaterial motion and reduces the exergy drop. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a novel solution that seamlessly integrates two technologies, mobile cloud computing and microwave power transfer (MPT), to enable computation in passive low-complexity devices such as sensors and wearable computing devices. Specifically, considering a single-user system, a base station (BS) either transfers power to or offloads computation from a mobile to the cloud; the mobile uses harvested energy to compute given data either locally or by offloading. A framework for energy efficient computing is proposed that comprises a set of policies for controlling CPU cycles for the mode of local computing, time division between MPT and offloading for the other mode of offloading, and mode selection. Given the CPU-cycle statistics information and channel state information (CSI), the policies aim at maximizing the probability of successfully computing given data, called computing probability, under the energy harvesting and deadline constraints. The policy optimization is translated into the equivalent problems of minimizing the mobile energy consumption for local computing and maximizing the mobile energy savings for offloading which are solved using convex optimization theory. The structures of the resultant policies are characterized in closed form. Furthermore, given non-causal CSI, the said analytical framework is further developed to support computation load allocation over multiple channel realizations, which further increases the computing probability. Last, simulation demonstrates the feasibility of wirelessly powered mobile cloud computing and the gain of its optimal control.									324	7	0	0	1	1	324			0733-8716	1558-0008											2016-05-01	WOS:000377928600051

Herein, a semi-interpenetrating ionic conductive hydrogel (SICH) is fabricated by a hydrogel-network constrained polymerization of 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazole tetrafluoroborate and acrylic acid in polyethylene oxide aqueous solution. Ascribing to the formation of a dense intermolecular hydrogen-bonded network, the SICH is capable of being stretched up to-300%, compressed to-85%, and recovered immediately when the external force is fully released. The SICH can readily work as a high deformation-tolerant ionic conductor for capacitive/resistive bimodal ionic sensors. The ionic sensor not only showed a wide response range to dynamic pressures (0-8 kPa) and excellent cycling stability (500 cycles) in a capacitive mode, but also demonstrated high sensitivity (gauge factor of-1.1), excellent linear response (0-300% strain) and fast response time (80 ms) in a resistive mode. As a demonstration, a wearable bimodal SICH ionic sensor was assembled, showing high sensitivity, linearity, wide response range and great durability in detecting complex human motions including speaking and various joint bending.									63	1	0	0	9	0	64			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-01-22	WOS:000624519700004

So far few works have studied this problem. In this study, a general framework, termed TROIKA, is proposed, which consists of signal decomposiTion for denoising, sparse signal RecOnstructIon for high-resolution spectrum estimation, and spectral peaK trAcking with verification. The TROIKA framework has high estimation accuracy and is robust to strong motion artifacts. Many variants can be straightforwardly derived from this framework. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/h showed that the average absolute error of heart rate estimation was 2.34 beat per minute, and the Pearson correlation between the estimates and the ground truth of heart rate was 0.992. This framework is of great values to wearable devices such as smartwatches which use PPG signals to monitor heart rate for fitness.									396	13	0	0	49	1	417			0018-9294	1558-2531											2015-02-01	WOS:000348297000014	25252274

Despite wide investigations of smart contact lenses for diagnostic applications, there has been no report on electrically controlled drug delivery in combination with real-time biometric analysis. Here, we developed smart contact lenses for both continuous glucose monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. The smart contact lens device, built on a biocompatible polymer, contains ultrathin, flexible electrical circuits and a microcontroller chip for real-time electrochemical biosensing, on-demand controlled drug delivery, wireless power management, and data communication. In diabetic rabbit models, we could measure tear glucose levels to be validated by the conventional invasive blood glucose tests and trigger drugs to be released from reservoirs for treating diabetic retinopathy.

Conventional SCs have two-dimensional planar structures. As a new family of SCs, fiber SCs utilize one-dimensional cylindrically shaped fibers as electrodes. They have attracted significant interest since 2011 and have shown great application potential either as micro-scale devices to complement or even replace micro-batteries in miniaturized electronics and microelectromechanical systems or as macro-scale devices for wearable electronics or smart textiles. This tutorial review provides an essential introduction to this new field. We first introduce the basics of performance evaluation for fiber SCs as a foundation to understand different research approaches and the diverse performance metrics reported in the literature. Next, we summarize the current state-of-the-art progress in structure design and electrode fabrication of fiber SCs. This is followed by a discussion on the integration of multiple fiber SCs and the combination with other energy harvesting or storage devices. Last, we present our perspectives on the future development of fiber SCs and highlight key technical challenges with the hope of stimulating further research progress.									456	30	0	0	21	0	463			0306-0012	1460-4744											2015-01-01	WOS:000348922100004	25420877

Herein, we report a safe, flexible, self-powered wristband system by integrating high-performance zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with perovskite solar cells (PSCs). ZIBs were first fabricated on the basis of a defective MnO2, nanosheetgrown carbon cloth (MnO2-x@CC), which was obtained via the simple lithium treatment of the MnO2 nanosheets to slightly expand the interlayer spacing and generate rich oxygen vacancies. When used as a ZIB cathode, the MnO2-x@CC with a ultrahigh mass loading (up to 25.5 mg cm(-2)) exhibits a much enhanced specific capacity (3.63 mAh cm(-2) at current density of 3.93 mA cm(-2)), rate performance, and long cycle stability (no obvious degradation after 5000 cycles) than those of the MnO2@CC. Importantly, the MnO2-x@CC-based quasi-solid-state ZIB not only achieves excellent flexibility and an ultrahigh energy density of 5.11 mWh cm(-2) (59.42 mWh cm(-3)) but also presents a high safety under a wide temperature range and various severe conditions. More importantly, the flexible ZIBs can be integrated with flexible PSCs to construct a safe, self-powered wristband, which is able to harvest light energy and power a commercial smart bracelet. This work sheds light on the development of high-performance ZIB cathodes and thus offers a good strategy to construct wearable self-powered energy systems for wearable electronics.									97	13	0	0	3	0	98			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-07-15	WOS:000665748900125	34037383

Inspired by pulmonary lobe expansion/contraction observed during respiration, a respiration-driven triboelectric sensor (RTS) was devised for simultaneous respiratory biomechanical monitoring and exhaled acetone concentration analysis. A tin oxide-doped polyethyleneimine membrane was devised to play a dual role as both a triboelectric layer and an acetone sensing material. The prepared RTS exhibited excellent ability in measuring respiratory flow rate (2-8 L/min) and breath frequency (0.33-0.8 Hz). Furthermore, the RTS presented good performance in biochemical acetone sensing (2-10 ppm range at high moisture levels), which was validated via finite element analysis. This work has led to the development of a novel real-time active respiratory monitoring system and strengthened triboelectric-chemisorption coupling sensing mechanism.									63	1	0	0	3	0	63			1944-8244	1944-8252											2022-03-02	WOS:000757899400001	35076218

Hydrogels made from conducting polymers give rise to a promising integration of high conductivity and versatility in processing. However, the emergence of conducting polymer hydrogels with a desirable network structure cannot be readily achieved using conventional polymerization methods. Here we present a cryopolymerization strategy for preparing an intrinsically stretchable, compressible and bendable anisotropic polyvinyl alcohol/polyaniline hydrogel with a complete recovery of 100% stretching strain, 50% compressing strain and fully bending. Due to its high mechanical strength, superelastic properties and bi-continuous phase structure, the as-obtained anisotropic polyvinyl alcohol/polyaniline hydrogel can work as a stretching/compressing/bending electrode, maintaining its stable output under complex deformations for an all-solid-state supercapacitor. In particular, it achieves an extremely high energy density of 27.5 Wh kg(-1), which is among that of state-of-the-art stretchable supercapacitors.									166	2	0	0	19	0	165			2041-1723												2020-01-07	WOS:000511962400001	32024823

In this study, we design and fabricate a flexible, stretchable, and highly transparent TENG based on an unsymmetrical PAM/BTO composite film, made of polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel and BaTiO3 nanocubes (BTO NCs, BTO), and the TENG performance can be tailored by adjusting the amount and distribution location of BTO. The stretchable hydrogel electrode could bear over 8 times stretching. By changing the content and distribution location of BTO in the unsymmetrical hydrogel film, the output of the fabricated TENGs could be improved, acting as pressure sensors with high sensitivity to distinguish a spectrum of forces (0.25-6 N) at the low frequency. The mechanism of the enhanced output performance of the PAM/BTO composite hydrogel-based TENG is discussed in detail. By integrating piezoresistive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric effects, the optimized TENG and piezoresistive sensors are used as multimodal biomechanical sensors for detecting the motions of human bodies, pressure, and curvature with high sensitivity.									42	1	0	0	7	0	43			1936-0851	1936-086X											2022-01-21	WOS:000743224400001	35014254

For some given applications, a combination of desirable mechanical properties including stiffness, strength, toughness, damping, fatigue resistance, and self-healing ability is required. However, integrating such a rigorous set of requirements imposes substantial complexity and difficulty in the design and fabrication of these polymer networks, and has rarely been realized. Here, we describe the construction of supramolecular polymer networks through an in situ copolymerization of acrylamide and functional monomers, which are dynamically complexed with the host molecule cucurbit[8] uril (CB[8]). High molecular weight, thus sufficient chain entanglement, combined with a small-amount dynamic CB[8]-mediated non-covalent crosslinking (2.5 mol%), yields extremely stretchable and tough supramolecular polymer networks, exhibiting remarkable self-healing capability at room temperature. These supramolecular polymer networks can be stretched more than 100x their original length and are able to lift objects 2000x their weight. The reversible association/dissociation of the host-guest complexes bestows the networks with remarkable energy dissipation capability, but also facile complete self-healing at room temperature. In addition to their outstanding mechanical properties, the networks are ionically conductive and transparent. The CB[8]-based supramolecular networks are synthetically accessible in large scale and exhibit outstanding mechanical properties. They could readily lead to the promising use as wearable and self-healable electronic devices, sensors and structural biomaterials.									313	17	0	0	27	0	321			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-06-13	WOS:000402963400012	28370560

In order to construct high performance TE devices, superior TE materials have to be targeted via various strategies. The development of high performance TE devices can broaden the market of TE application and eventually boost the enthusiasm of TE material research. This review focuses on major novel strategies to achieve high-performance TE materials and their applications. Manipulating the carrier concentration and band structures of materials are effective in optimizing the electrical transport properties, while nanostructure engineering and defect engineering can greatly reduce the thermal conductivity approaching the amorphous limit. Currently, TE devices are utilized to generate power in remote missions, solar-thermal systems, implantable or/wearable devices, the automotive industry, and many other fields; they are also serving as temperature sensors and controllers or even gas sensors. The future tendency is to synergistically optimize and integrate all the effective factors to further improve the TE performance, so that highly efficient TE materials and devices can be more beneficial to daily lives.									492	22	0	0	17	0	499			1614-6832	1614-6840											2018-12-28	WOS:000426152400012

However, the rational design of a novel electrode structure with a good flexibility, high capacity, fast charge-discharge rate and long cycling lifetimes remains a long-standing challenge for developing next-generation flexible energy-storage materials. Herein, we develop a facile and general approach to three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous nitrogen-doped graphene foam with encapsulated Ge quantum dot/nitrogen-doped graphene yolk-shell nano architecture for high specific reversible capacity (1,220mAhg(-1)), long cycling capability (over 96% reversible capacity retention from the second to 1,000 cycles) and ultra-high rate performance (over 800 mAhg(-1) at 40 degrees C).

Herein, we demonstrate fiber-shaped photodetectors constructed by vertical organic-inorganic heterostructures, which achieves self-powered behavior and promoted photoresponse under series of coaxial p-n junctions and piezophototronic mechanism. Tunable photoresponse and ultrafast response and recovery (< 40 ms) are realized at zero bias by controlling bend-induced piezo-potentials of the photodetector. For the bended device with 1.96% strain, the photoresponse is enhanced 81.2% by the piezo-phototronic effect compared to the device under no strain. FEM simulation indicates that the non-uniform strain and piezo-potential distribution on the bended fiber device promotes carrier separation in the coaxial interfaces of p-n junctions, and thus improving the light detection ability. The present work provides a promising strategy for improving fiber-shaped photodetectors as well as a new idea for self-powered and ultrafast light detection in portable and wearable applications.									82	0	0	0	4	0	82			2211-2855	2211-3282											2021-11-26	WOS:000720199800001

Even so, there exist few studies that can integrate energy harvesting and self-powered sensing into a single electronic skin. Here, a stretchable and washable skin-inspired triboelectric nanogenerator (SI-TENG) is developed for both biomechanical energy harvesting and versatile pressure sensing. A planar and designable conductive yarn network constructed from a three-ply-twisted silver-coated nylon yarn is embedded into flexible elastomer, endowing the SI-TENG with desired stretchability, good sensitivity, high detection precision, fast responsivity, and excellent mechanical stability. With a maximum average power density of 230 mW m(-2), the SI-TENG is able to light up 170 light-emitting diodes, charge various capacitors, and drive miniature electronic products. As a self-powered multifunctional sensor, the SI-TENG is adopted to monitor human physiological signals, such as arterial pulse and voice vibrations. Furthermore, an intelligent prosthetic hand, a self-powered pedometer/speedometer, a flexible digital keyboard, and a proof-of-concept pressure-sensor array with 8 x 8 sensing pixels are successively demonstrated to further confirm its versatile application prospects. Based on these merits, the developed SI-TENG has promising applications in wearable powering technology, physiological monitoring, intelligent prostheses, and human-machine interfaces.									326	14	0	0	17	0	327			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-10-25	WOS:000448786000031	30256476

However, flexible sensors (e.g. electronic skin) in practice require to perceive both strain and pressure concurrently and repeatedly, which put forward an imperative demand for multi-model and durable hydrogel sensors. Additionally, freezing intolerance is also an urgent problem to be addressed for low-temperature applications of hydrogel sensors. Herein, we constructed a wearable multi-model hydrogel sensor featuring with sensitive and large-range strain and pressure detection capacity, together with long-term stability and wide operating temperature range, based on a resilient, anti-fatigue and freezing-tolerant chitosan-poly (hydroxyethyl acrylamide) double-network (CS-PHEAA DN) hydrogel, which was fabricated via post-cross-linking CS-PHEAA composite hydrogel into Na(3)Cit solution. The ions simultaneously furnished the hydrogel with superior mechanics (stretchability, supercompressibility, excellent resilience and remarkable fatigue resistance), prominent ionic conductivity and low temperature tolerance. Impressively, the assembled hydrogel sensor exhibited preeminent sensitivity and cycling stability on detecting multi-type and large-range deformation (elongation, compression and bend), pressure and various human motions even at low temperatures. Remarkably, the fabricated hydrogel/aluminum hybrid combination serving as a flexible sensor maintained mechanical advantages, sensitive sensing capacity and good durability within a wide temperature range. This work provides a feasible method to construct anti-freezing, durable and multi-mode hydrogel sensors with high sensitivity and large-range detection capacity and paves a way for versatile applications in electronic skin, human-motion detection and intelligence device.									156	6	0	0	31	0	159			1385-8947	1873-3212											2020-11-03	WOS:000579752500128

Both a silver (Ag)-coated textile and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanopatterns based on ZnO nanorod arrays on a Ag-coated textile template were used as active triboelectric materials. A high output voltage and current of about 120 V and 65 mu A, respectively, were observed from a nanopatterned PDMS-based WING, while an output voltage and current of 30 V and 20 mu A were obtained by the non-nanopatterned flat PDMS-based WING under the same compressive force of 10 kgf. Furthermore, very high voltage and current outputs with an average value of 170 V and 120 mu A, respectively, were obtained from a four-layer-stacked WING under the same compressive force. Notably it was found there are no significant differences in the output voltages measured from the multilayer-stacked WING over 12 000 cycles, confirming the excellent mechanical durability of WTNGs. Finally, we successfully demonstrated the self-powered operation of light-emitting diodes, a liquid crystal display, and a keyless vehicle entry system only with the output power of our WING without any help of external power sources.									516	16	1	0	20	0	531			1936-0851	1936-086X											2015-04-01	WOS:000353867000013	25670211

They need to allow more intimate contact with human beings to enable advanced health monitoring, disease detection, medical therapies, and human machine interfacing. However, current electronics are rigid, nondegradable and cannot self-repair, while the human body is soft, dynamic, stretchable, biodegradable, and self-healing. Therefore, it is critical to develop a new class of electronic materials that incorporate skinlike properties, including stretchability for conformable integration, minimal discomfort and suppressed invasive reactions; self-healing for long-term durability under harsh mechanical conditions; and biodegradability for reducing environmental impact and obviating the need for secondary device removal for medical implants. These demands have fueled the development of a new generation of electronic materials, primarily composed of polymers and polymer composites with both high electrical performance and skinlike properties, and consequently led to a new paradigm of electronics, termed "skin-inspired electronics".This Account covers recent important advances in skin-inspired electronics, from basic material developments to device components and proof-of-concept demonstrations for integrated bioelectronics applications. To date, stretchability has been the most prominent focus in this field. In contrast to strain-engineering approaches that extrinsically impart stretchability into inorganic electronics, intrinsically stretchable materials provide a direct route to achieve higher mechanical robustness, higher device density, and scalable fabrication. The key is the introduction of strain-dissipation mechanisms into the material design, which has been realized through molecular engineering (e.g., soft molecular segments, dynamic bonds) and physical engineering (e.g., nanoconfinement effect, geometric design). The material design concepts have led to the successful demonstrations of stretchable conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics without sacrificing their electrical performance. Employing such materials, innovative device design coupled with fabrication method development has enabled stretchable sensors and displays as input/output components and large-scale transistor arrays for circuits and active matrixes. Strategies to incorporate self-healing into electronic materials are the second focus of this Account. To date, dynamic intermolecular interactions have been the most effective approach for imparting self-healing properties onto polymeric electronic materials, which have been utilized to fabricate self-healing sensors and actuators. Moreover, biodegradability has emerged as an important feature in skin-inspired electronics. The incorporation of degradable moieties along the polymer backbone allows for degradable conducting polymers and the use of bioderived materials has led to the demonstration of biodegradable functional devices, such as sensors and transistors. Finally, we highlight examples of skin-inspired electronics for three major applications: prosthetic e-skins, wearable electronics, and implantable electronics.									336	11	0	0	32	0	338			0001-4842	1520-4898											2018-05-01	WOS:000432418000006	29693379

In this paper, we devoted to fabricating flexible metacomposite films, which have great potential applications in the field of wearable cloaks, sensing, perfect absorption and stretchable electronic devices. The conductivity and the complex permittivity were investigated in flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) membranous nanocomposites, which were fabricated via in-situ polymerization process. With the increase of conductive onedimension carbon nanotubes concentration, there was a percolation transition observed in conduction due to the formation of continuous networks. The dielectric dispersion behavior was also analyzed in the spectra of complex permittivity. It is indicated that the conduction and polarization make a combined effect on the dielectric loss in flexible PDMS/MWCNTs composites. The negative permittivity with a dielectric resonance was obtained, and was attributed to the induced electric dipoles.

Thermoelectrochemical cells (TECs) with large Seebeck coefficient can efficiently convert low-grade heat into electricity, thus having attracted considerable attention in recent years. Utilizing hydrogel electrolyte essentially addresses the electrolyte leakage and complicated packaging issues existing in conventional liquid-based TECs, which well satisfies the need for flexibility. Whereas, the concern of mechanical robustness to ensure stable energy output remains yet to be addressed. Herein, a flexible quasi-solid-state TEC is proposed based on the rational design of a hydrogel electrolyte, of which the thermogalvanic effect and mechanical robustness are simultaneously regulated via the multivalent ions of a redox couple. The introduced redox ions not only endow the hydrogel with excellent heat-to-electricity conversion capability, but also act as ionic crosslinks to afford a dual-crosslinked structure, resulting in reversible bonds for effective energy dissipation. The optimized TEC exhibits a high Seebeck coefficient of 1.43 mV K-1 and a significantly improved fracture toughness of 3555 J m(-2), thereby can maintain a stable thermoelectrochemical performance against various harsh mechanical stimuli. This study reveals the high potential of the quasi-solid-state TEC as a flexible and durable energy supply system for wearable applications.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2311-6706	2150-5551											2022-04-25	WOS:000782151100003	35333992

AM is a materials-oriented manufacturing technology, and printing resolution versus printing scalability/speed trade-off exists among various types of materials, including polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses, and composite materials. Four-dimensional (4D) printing, together with versatile transformation systems, drives researchers to achieve and utilize high dimensional AM. Multiple perspectives of the AM of structural materials have been raised and illustrated in this review, including multimaterial AM (MMa-AM), multi-modulus AM (MMo-AM), multi-scale AM (MSc-AM), multi-system AM (MSyAM), multi-dimensional AM (MD-AM), and multi-function AM (MF-AM). The rapid and tremendous development of AM materials and methods offers great potential for structural applications, such as in the aerospace field, the biomedical field, electronic devices, nuclear industry, flexible and wearable devices, soft sensors, actuators, and robotics, jewelry and art decorations, land transportation, underwater devices, and porous structures.									139	12	0	0	4	0	144			0927-796X	1879-212X											2021-07-01	WOS:000669044700001

However, high-performance wearable nickel/cobalt-zinc-based batteries are rarely reported because there is a lack of industrially weavable and knittable highly conductive yarns. Here, we use scalably produced highly conductive yarns uniformly covered with zinc (as anode) and nickel cobalt hydroxide nanosheets (as cathode) to fabricate rechargeable yarn batteries. They possess a battery level capacity and energy density, as well as a supercapacitor level power density. They deliver high specific capacity of 5 mAh cm-3 and energy densities of 0.12 mWh cm(-2) and 8 mWh cm(-3) (based on the whole solid battery). They exhibit ultrahigh rate capabilities of 232 C (liquid electrolyte) and 116 C (solid electrolyte), which endows the batteries excellent power densities of 32.8 mW cm(-2) and 2.2 W cm(-3) (based on the whole solid battery). These are among the highest values reported so far. A wrist band battery is further constructed by using a large conductive cloth woven from the conductive yarns by a commercial weaving machine. It powers various electronic devices successfully, enabling dual functions of wearability and energy storage.									262	14	0	0	11	0	266			1936-0851	1936-086X											2017-09-01	WOS:000411918200043	28813141

The OAR-ZABs acquire a higher open circuit potential of 1.408 V, larger specific capacity of 738 mA h g(-1), and better rechargeability (105 cycles/35 h) compared with most reported devices employing traditional PVA basic hydrogel electrolyte. The exhibited areal/specific energy densities (7.53 mW h cm(-2)/900.4 Wh kg(-1)) also outperform the values of competitors such as micro-supercapacitors (<= 0.01 mW h cm(-2)) and Li-ion batteries (<= 200 Wh kg(1)). Furthermore, the reasonable in-plane electrode deployment endows the OAR-ZABs with good coplanar integration capability and high flexibility, allowing in-plane series/parallel connection to output required voltage/current and working stably at different bending angles. Combined with the other advantages including its miniaturization and the inherent security of employed hydrogel electrolyte, the OAR-ZABs are ideally suitable for wearable applications. As a demo, a flexible OAR-ZABs array in series connection is fabricated and conformally sewed on clothes, being safely used to charge the smart phone or light the safety warning device. All these make them competitive micropower sources for wearable microelectronics.									125	5	0	0	4	0	126			0926-3373	1873-3883											2020-01-01	WOS:000496894300065

Herein, a kind of highly electronegative and conducing material of MXene nanosheet has been innovatively integrated with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for electrospinning nanofibers film to fabricate flexible all-electrospun triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Silk fibroin (SF) was chosen for electrospinning nanofibers film to serve as electron donor for TENG with great triboelectricity and biocompatible nature. The MXene-based all-electrospun nanogenerator shows excellent stability and durability as well as extraordinary electrical performance, which supports an instantaneously maximum peak power density of 1087.6 mW/m(2) as the load resistance is 5.0 M Omega. Moreover, beyond harvesting electrical power, the fabricated TENG was utilized for real-time monitoring various types of body motion. Lastly, we used the developed TENG to power electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) chip to actuate droplet transport. Considering the excellent triboelectric performance, ease of large-scale manufacturing, and environmental friendliness, this MXene-based all-electrospun TENG provides a promising solution for developing practical, flexible, and self-powered electronic devices.									243	9	0	0	19	0	243			2211-2855	2211-3282											2019-04-12	WOS:000463032200029

However, it still remains still a big challenge to fabricate strain sensors with high sensitivity over a wide workable strain range. In order to meet this challenge, a new type of strain sensor based on elastomer/carbon nanotube composite fiber is reported in this work. Elastomer fibers are initially prepared via the electrospinning of styrene ethylene butene styrene block copolymer (SEBS). The resultant SEBS fibers are then functionalized by sequentially coating with dopamine (DA) coating and carboxyl group (-COOH) grafted multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under vacuum filtration and ultrasonication. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis reveals that a large amount of MWCNTs is firmly bonded onto the SEBS fibers and evenly distributed. SEBS@PDA/MWCNTs composite fibers based strain sensors exhibit excellent performance, including a high gauge factor of 3717 and large workable strain range up to 530%. Furthermore, the developed sensors demonstrate excellent washing fastness and superior sensitivity in monitoring both small strains (e.g., pulse beats and vocal cord vibrations) and large strains (e.g., finger, elbow, and knee bending).									77	2	0	0	1	0	78			2199-160X												2021-06-16	WOS:000659159200001

The most effective piezoelectric materials are ceramic solid solutions in which the piezoelectric effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). Ceramics are not ideal for a variety of applications owing to some of their mechanical properties. We synthesized piezoelectric materials from a molecular perovskite (TMFM)(x)(TMCM)(1-x)CdCl3 solid solution (TMFM, trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium; TMCM, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium, 0 <= x =<= 1), in which the MPB exists between monoclinic and hexagonal phases. We found a composition for which the piezoelectric coefficient d(33) is similar to 1540 picocoulombs per newton, comparable to high-performance piezoelectric ceramics. The material has potential applications for wearable piezoelectric devices.									317	17	0	0	22	0	322			0036-8075	1095-9203											2019-03-15	WOS:000461329000046	30872522

Sodium excreted during perspiration is an excellent marker for electrolyte imbalance and provides valuable information regarding an individual's physical and mental wellbeing. The realization of the new skin-worn non-invasive tattoo-like sensing device has been realized by amalgamating several state-of-the-art thick film, laser printing, solid-state potentiometry, fluidics and wireless technologies. The resulting tattoo-based potentiometric sodium sensor displays a rapid near-Nernstian response with negligible carryover effects, and good resiliency against various mechanical deformations experienced by the human epidermis. On-body testing of the tattoo sensor coupled to a wireless transceiver during exercise activity demonstrated its ability to continuously monitor sweat sodium dynamics. The real-time sweat sodium concentration was transmitted wirelessly via a body-worn transceiver from the sodium tattoo sensor to a notebook while the subjects perspired on a stationary cycle. The favorable analytical performance along with the wearable nature of the wireless transceiver makes the new epidermal potentiometric sensing system attractive for continuous monitoring the sodium dynamics in human perspiration during diverse activities relevant to the healthcare, fitness, military, healthcare and skin-care domains.

While many challenges remain with respect to the mechanical design of such devices, it is at least equally challenging and important to develop strategies to control them in concert with the intentions of the user.This work reviews the state-of-the-art techniques for controlling portable active lower limb prosthetic and orthotic (P/O) devices in the context of locomotive activities of daily living (ADL), and considers how these can be interfaced with the user's sensory-motor control system. This review underscores the practical challenges and opportunities associated with P/O control, which can be used to accelerate future developments in this field. Furthermore, this work provides a classification scheme for the comparison of the various control strategies.As a novel contribution, a general framework for the control of portable gait-assistance devices is proposed. This framework accounts for the physical and informatic interactions between the controller, the user, the environment, and the mechanical device itself. Such a treatment of P/Os - not as independent devices, but as actors within an ecosystem - is suggested to be necessary to structure the next generation of intelligent and multifunctional controllers.Each element of the proposed framework is discussed with respect to the role that it plays in the assistance of locomotion, along with how its states can be sensed as inputs to the controller. The reviewed controllers are shown to fit within different levels of a hierarchical scheme, which loosely resembles the structure and functionality of the nominal human central nervous system (CNS). Active and passive safety mechanisms are considered to be central aspects underlying all of P/O design and control, and are shown to be critical for regulatory approval of such devices for real-world use.The works discussed herein provide evidence that, while we are getting ever closer, significant challenges still exist for the development of controllers for portable powered P/O devices that can seamlessly integrate with the user's neuromusculoskeletal system and are practical for use in locomotive ADL.									461	11	1	0	42	4	474				1743-0003											2015-01-05	WOS:000348398600001	25557982

This is because of their safe nature, low cost, and good mechanical characteristics. However, conventional hydrogel electrolytes face limitation at subzero temperatures. Herein, we report an antifreezing, safe, and nontoxic gel electrolyte based on the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/Zn/ethylene glycol system. The optimal gel electrolyte membrane exhibits a high ionic conductivity (15.03 mS cm(-1) at room temperature) and promising antifreezing performance (9.05 mS cm(-1) at -20 degrees C and 3.53 mS cm(-1) at -40 degrees C). Moreover, the antifreezing gel electrolyte can suppress the growth of Zn dendrites to display a uniform Zn plating/stripping behavior. Also, a flexible antifreezing Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor fabricated with the optimum antifreezing gel electrolyte membrane exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. The supercapacitor possesses a high specific capacity of 247.7 F g(-1) at room temperature under a high working voltage of 2 V. It also displays an outstanding cyclic stability at room temperature. Moreover, the supercapacitor shows an extraordinary electrochemical behavior and cyclic stability over up to 30 000 cycles at -20 degrees C under a current load of 5 A g(-1), demonstrating its outstanding low-temperature electrochemical performance. Besides, the antifreezing supercapacitor device also offers high flexibility under different deformation conditions. Therefore, it is believed that this work provides a simplistic method of realizing the application of flexible antifreezing Zn-ion energy storage devices in a subzero-temperature environment.									88	4	0	0	5	0	89			1944-8244	1944-8252											2021-04-01	WOS:000641156600047	33789423

How to effectively integrate various functional energy fibers into them and realize versatile applications is an urgent need to be fulfilled. Here, a multifunctional coaxial energy fiber has been developed toward energy harvesting, energy storage, and energy utilization. The energy fiber is composed of an all fiber-shaped triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), supercapacitor (SC), and pressure sensor in a coaxial geometry. The inner core is a fibrous SC by a green activation strategy for energy storage; the outer sheath is a fibrous TENG in single-electrode mode for energy harvesting, and the outer friction layer and inner layer (covered with Ag) constitute a self-powered pressure sensor. The electrical performances of each energy component are systematically investigated. The fibrous SC shows a length specific capacitance density of 13.42 mF.cm(-1), good charging/discharging rate capability, and excellent cycling stability (similar to 96.6% retention). The fibrous TENG shows a maximum power of 2.5 mu W to power an electronic watch and temperature sensor. The pressure sensor has a good enough sensitivity of 1.003 V.kPa(-1) to readily monitor the real-time finger motions and work as a tactile interface. The demonstrated energy fibers have exhibited stable electrochemical and mechanical performances under mechanical deformation, which make them attractive for wearable electronics. The demonstrated soft and multifunctional coaxial energy fiber is also of great significance in a sustainable human-machine interactive system, intelligent robotic skin, security tactile switches, etc.									83	4	0	0	1	0	83			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-01-11	WOS:000613942700130	33428394

Among the organic/polymer TE materials reported so far, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenensulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is extensively investigated because it is water-processable, thermally stable, and can be highly conductive. Over the past few years, the TE properties of the PEDOT-based TE materials are continuously improved. With rational design, some PEDOT:PSS-based materials have achieved high ZT values comparable to the conventional inorganic TE materials like bismuth telluride at room temperature. This paper reviews the recent breakthroughs for PEDOT:PSS-based TE polymers and composites. The strategies for achieving high-performance PEDOT:PSS-based TE materials and the corresponding underlying mechanism are specifically discussed. The TE devices fabricated by the PEDOT:PSS-based TE materials are also presented, in terms of their fabrication/assembly technique, device configuration and device performance. With all the exciting progress made in the PEDOT:PSS-based TE materials, the further development and practical applications of the high-efficient organic TE materials as flexible TE module devices and wearable electronics can be greatly anticipated.									185	6	0	0	9	0	187			2199-160X												2019-11-28	WOS:000496244000007

Integrating displays into textiles offers exciting opportunities for smart electronictextiles-the ultimate goal of wearable technology, poised to change the way in which we interact with electronic devices(3-6). Display textiles serve to bridge human-machine interactions(7-9), offering, for instance, a real-time communication tool for individuals with voice or speech difficulties. Electronictextiles capable of communicating(10), sensing(11,12) and supplying electricity(13,14) have been reported previously. However, textiles with functional, large-area displays have not yet been achieved, because it is challenging to obtain small illuminating unitsthat are both durable and easy to assemble over a wide area. Here we report a 6-metre-long, 25-centimetre-wide display textile containing 5 x10(5 )electroluminescent units spaced approximately 800 micrometres apart. Weaving conductive weft and luminescent warp fibres forms micrometre-scale electroluminescent units at the weft-warp contact points. The brightness between electroluminescent units deviates by less than 8 per cent and remains stable even when the textile is bent, stretched or pressed. Our display textile is flexible and breathable and withstands repeated machine-washing, making it suitable for practical applications. We showthat an integrated textile system consisting of display, keyboard and power supply can serve as a communication tool, demonstrating the system's potential within the Internet of things' in various areas, including healthcare. Our approach unifies the fabrication and function of electronic devices with textiles, and we expect that woven-fibre materials will shape the next generation of electronics.									330	30	0	0	25	0	338			0028-0836	1476-4687											2021-03-11	WOS:000627422700011	33692559

How to simultaneously realize their highly transparent, self-healing, antifreezing/antidrying, biocompatible and highly conductive features through a simple approach is still a challenge. Herein, the stretchable freezing-tolerant triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and strain sensor have been developed based on a transparent, long-term stable, and highly conductive gelatin/NaCl organohydrogel (GNOH), which is prepared via a facile immersion strategy in a glycerol/water binary solvent. The GNOH demonstrates superior merits of strain (300%), transparency (85%), high conductivity (1.6 S/m), freezing tolerance (-20 degrees C), self-healing capability (91%), and environment stability (over 30 days). Furthermore, the wearable strain sensors enable the detecting, quantifying, and monitoring of human activities with high sensitivity of about 2.5 (strain of 0-200%). Meanwhile, the fabricated TENG in single-electrode mode can achieve excellent electrical outputs to power portable electronics when efficiently harvesting biomechanical energies, even at harsh cold temperature (-20 degrees C). Additionally, a flexible self-powered calculator based on the arrayed TENG as touch panel is also explored for human-machine interaction (HMI). This study paves the way for potential applications in wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring, biomechanical energy harvesting and HMI.									44	3	0	0	4	0	45			2211-2855	2211-3282											2022-07-15	WOS:000820983300002

This study reports a broadband NIR Ca3-xLuxHf2Al2+xSi1-xO12:Cr3+ garnet phosphor with emission intensity enhanced by 81.5 times. Chemical unit co-substitution of [Lu3+-Al3+] for [Ca2+-Si4+] is responsible for the luminescence enhancement and further alters the crystal structure and electronic properties of the garnet. Using the optimized phosphor, a NIR pc-LED with photoelectric efficiencies of 21.28%@10 mA, 15.75%@100 mA and NIR output powers of 46.09 mW@100 mA, 54.29 mW@130 mA is fabricated. The high power NIR light is observed to penetrate upper arms (approximate to 8 cm). For application in NIR spectroscopy, the NIR pc-LED is used as light source to measure transmission spectra of water, alcohol, and bovine hemoglobin solution. These results indicate the NIR garnet phosphor to be a promising candidate for NIR pc-LED.									202	17	0	0	10	0	211			2195-1071												2019-06-01	WOS:000471918700015

Very recently, ST-OSCs have seen remarkable progress, with a rapid increase in power conversion efficiency from below 7% to 12-14%, with an average visible transparency of 9-25%, especially due to the use of low bandgap semiconductors including polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors that exhibit absorption in the near-infrared region as photoabsorbent materials. From this perspective, the latest developments in ST-OSCs stemming from the innovations in photovoltaic materials that delivered multifunctional ST-OSCs with top-of-the-line power conversion efficiencies are discussed to shed light on the structure-property relationship between molecular design and current challenges in this cutting-edge research field. Finally, personal perspectives, including research directions for the future use of ST-OSCs in multifunctional applications, are also proposed.									73	2	0	0	3	0	73			1616-301X	1616-3028											2021-01-28	WOS:000608231100001

Especially, many kinds of paper-based (PB) sensors have been reported for wearable applications in recent years. Among them, the PB gas, humidity, and strain sensors are widely studied for monitoring gas, humidity, and strain from the human body and the environment. However, gas, humidity, and strain often coexist and interact, and the paper itself is hydrophilic and flexible, resulting in that it is still challenging to develop high-performance PB sensors specialized for gas, humidity, and strain detections. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize and discuss them systematically. In this review, we focus on summarizing the state-of-art studies of the PB gas, humidity, and strain sensors. Specifically, the fabrications (electrodes and sensing materials) and applications of PB gas, humidity, and strain sensors are summarized and discussed. The current challenges and the potential trends of PB sensors for gas, humidity, and strain detections are also outlined. This review not only can help readers to understand the development status of the PB gas, humidity, and strain sensors but also is helpful for readers to find out and solve the problems in this field through comparative reading.									204	10	0	0	12	0	206			1944-8244	1944-8252											2020-08-05	WOS:000551488400001	32584534

However, their highest certified efficiency of 19.9% lags behind their rigid counterparts (highest 25.7%), mainly due to defective interfaces at charge-selective contacts with perovskites on top. Here we use a mixture of two hole-selective molecules based on carbazole cores and phosphonic acid anchoring groups to form a self-assembled monolayer and bridge perovskite with a low temperature-processed NiO nanocrystal film. The hole-selective contact mitigates interfacial recombination and facilitates hole extraction. We show flexible all-perovskite tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 24.7% (certified 24.4%), outperforming all types of flexible thin-film solar cell. We also report 23.5% efficiency for larger device areas of 1.05 cm(2). The molecule-bridged interfaces enable significant bending durability of flexible all-perovskite tandem solar cells that retain their initial performance after 10,000 cycles of bending at a radius of 15 mm.The efficiency of flexible perovskite solar cells lags behind their rigid counterparts. Now, Li et al. devise a self-assembled monolayer bridged hole-selective contact with reduced defects and improved bending durability, achieving a 24.4% certified efficiency.									57	5	0	0	1	0	60			2058-7546												2022-06-20	WOS:000808446800002

Herein, the hierarchical Ti3C2Tx MXene/Ni chain/ZnO array hybrid nanostructures are rationally constructed on cotton fabric for acquiring enhanced MA performance and durable self-cleaning ability. Based on the high dielectric loss capacity of MXenes and ZnO arrays, by controlling dip-coating numbers of Ni chains, the magnetic loss can be manipulated to modulate the impedance matching, reflection loss (RL), and effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, the bandwidth of RL < -10 dB). The minimum RL value of the designed fabric can reach -35.1 dB at 8.3 GHz with a thickness of 2.8 mm, and its EAB can cover the whole X-band with only a 2.2 mm thickness. In addition, the designed fabric also exhibits superior liquid repellency and durable self-cleaning ability due to the combination of the hybrid nanostructures and a superhydrophobic coating. This work provides an insight for rational design of textile-based MA materials, showing potential applications in flexible and wearable functional electronics.									184	13	0	0	13	0	184			1936-0851	1936-086X											2020-09-10	WOS:000557762800084	32628459

Such miniaturization is expected to lead to compact, nanoscale optical devices with applications in cameras, lighting, displays and wearable optics. However, retaining functionality while reducing device size has proven particularly challenging. For example, so far there has been no demonstration of broadband achromatic metalenses covering the entire visible spectrum. Here, we show that by judicious design of nanofins on a surface, it is possible to simultaneously control the phase, group delay and group delay dispersion of light, thereby achieving a transmissive achromatic metalens with large bandwidth. We demonstrate diffraction-limited achromatic focusing and achromatic imaging from 470 to 670 nm. Our metalens comprises only a single layer of nanostructures whose thickness is on the order of the wavelength, and does not involve spatial multiplexing or cascading. While this initial design (numerical aperture of 0.2) has an efficiency of about 20% at 500 nm, we discuss ways in which our approach may be further optimized to meet the demand of future applications.									943	103	1	0	38	0	978			1748-3387	1748-3395											2018-03-01	WOS:000427009000015	29292382

Such tuning is usually performed longitudinally along the optical axis by mechanical or electrical control of focal length. However, the recent advent of ultrathin planar lenses based on metasurfaces (metalenses), which opens the door to future drastic miniaturization of mobile devices such as cell phones and wearable displays, mandates fundamentally different forms of tuning based on lateral motion rather than longitudinal motion. Theory shows that the strain field of a metalens substrate can be directly mapped into the outgoing optical wavefront to achieve large diffractionlimited focal length tuning and control of aberrations. We demonstrate electrically tunable large-area metalenses controlled by artificial muscles capable of simultaneously performing focal length tuning (> 100%) as well as onthe-fly astigmatism and image shift corrections, which until now were only possible in electron optics. The device thickness is only 30 mm. Our results demonstrate the possibility of future optical microscopes that fully operate electronically, as well as compact optical systems that use the principles of adaptive optics to correct many orders of aberrations simultaneously.									249	26	0	0	13	0	261			2375-2548												2018-02-01	WOS:000426845500048	29507880

While various commercially wearable sensors are on the market with their capability of "quantitative assessments" on human health, physical, and psychological states, their sensing is mostly based on physical traits, and thus lacks precision in HHPM. Minimally or noninvasive biomarkers detectable from the human body, such as body fluid (e.g., sweat, tear, urine, and interstitial fluid), exhaled breath, and skin surface, can provide abundant additional information to the HHPM. Detecting these biomarkers with novel or existing sensor technologies is emerging as critical human monitoring research. This review provides a broad perspective on the state of the art biosensor technologies for HHPM, including the list of biomarkers and their physiochemical/physical characteristics, fundamental sensing principles, and high-performance sensing transducers. Further, this paper expands to the additional scope on the key technical challenges in applying the current HHPM system to the real field.									17	1	0	0	4	0	17				2198-3844											2022-01-19	WOS:000741832900001	35023321

Because of their potential human health-related applications, soft bioelectronics require stringent demands for biocompatible components. Silk, as a kind of well-known ancient natural biopolymer, shows unique combined merits such as good biocompatibility, programmable biodegradability, processability into various material formats, and large-scale sustainable production. Such unique merits have made silk popular for intensive design and study in soft bioelectronics over the past decade. Due to the development of fabrication techniques in material processing and progress in research, silk has been engineered into a variety of advanced materials including silk fibers/textiles, nanofibers, films, hydrogels, and aerogels. Natural and regenerated silk materials can also be transformed into intrinsically nitrogen-doped and electrically conductive carbon materials, due to their unique molecular structure and high nitrogen content. The rich morphologies and varied processing options for silk materials can furnish transformed carbon materials with well -designed structures and properties. The favorable and unique material merits of silk materials and silk-derived carbon materials offer potential applications in soft electronics. Based on commercial silk fibers/textiles and the availability of re -engineered silk materials with versatile technological formats, functional soft electronics have been explored with silk as flexible biosupports/biomatrixes or active components. These soft systems include bioresorbable electronics, ultraconformal bioelectronics, transient electronics, epidermal electronics, textile electronics, conformal biosensors, flexible transistors, and resistive switching memory devices. Silk-derived carbon materials with rationally designed morphologies and structures have also been developed as active components for wearable sensors, electronic skins, and flexible energy devices, which provide novel concepts and opportunities for soft electronics.In this Account, we highlight the unique hierarchical and chemical structure of natural silk fibers, the fabrication strategies for processing silk into materials with versatile morphologies and into electrically conductive carbon materials, as well as recent progress in the development of silk-based advanced materials (silk materials and silk-derived carbon materials) for soft bioelectronics. The design and functionality of soft electronics developed with commercial silk fibers/textiles, re-engineered silk materials, and silk-derived carbon materials as biosubstrate/matrix and active components is introduced in detail. We further discuss future challenges and prospects for developing silk-based soft bioelectronics for wearable healthcare systems. By leveraging the unique advantages of silk-based advanced materials, the design and construction strategy for flexible electronics, as well as the potential of flexible electronics for conformable and intimate association with human tissues/organs, silk-based soft bioelectronics should have a significant impact on diverse healthcare fields.									163	15	0	0	22	0	169			0001-4842	1520-4898											2019-11-01	WOS:000491219500016	31536330

Here, we show that graphene doped with gold and combined with a gold mesh has improved electrochemical activity over bare graphene, sufficient to form a wearable patch for sweat-based diabetes monitoring and feedback therapy. The stretchable device features a serpentine bilayer of gold mesh and gold-doped graphene that forms an efficient electrochemical interface for the stable transfer of electrical signals. The patch consists of a heater, temperature, humidity, glucose and pH sensors and polymeric microneedles that can be thermally activated to deliver drugs transcutaneously. We show that the patch can be thermally actuated to deliver Metformin and reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.									1107	64	1	0	198	0	1137			1748-3387	1748-3395											2016-06-01	WOS:000377476800017	26999482

Organohydrogels are currently being widely studied and formed by dispersing immiscible hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymer networks or only hydrophilic polymer networks in an organic/water solvent system. In particular, they can not only inherit and carry forward the merits of hydrogels, but also have some unique advantageous features, such as anti-freezing and water retention abilities, solvent resistance, adjustable surface wettability, and shape memory effect, which are conducive to the wide environmental adaptability and intelligent applications. This review first summarizes the structure, preparation strategy, and unique advantages of the reported organohydrogels. Furthermore, organohydrogels can be optimized for electro-mechanical properties or endowed with various functionalities by adding or modifying various functional components owing to their modifiability. Correspondingly, different optimization strategies, mechanisms, and advanced developments are described in detail, mainly involving the mechanical properties, conductivity, adhesion, self-healing properties, and antibacterial properties of organohydrogels. Moreover, the applications of organohydrogels in flexible sensors, energy storage devices, nanogenerators, and biomedicine have been summarized, confirming their unlimited potential in future development. Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects of organohydrogels are provided.									44	3	0	0	2	0	43			2051-6347	2051-6355											2022-03-04	WOS:000756227000001	35156986

The density, porosity and average pore size of the composite foam are 0.13 g cm(-3), 83.7% and 24.9 mu m, respectively. CB particles are uniformly dispersed in the skeleton of the as-prepared foam, resulting in a low percolation threshold of 0.48 vol%. The CTF is capable of distinguishing different compressive strain by change of the relative resistance. Its responsive behaviors towards compressive strain present an excellent linear characteristic with a high gauge factor (GF) up to 1.55. In the piezoresistive tests, the CTF shows a fast response/relaxation time (150/150 ms), fascinating recoverability, excellent response stability within a wide workable detection range up to 80% strain (corresponding pressure of 584.4 kPa) and a superior durability (> 10000 cycles), which is mainly related to the pinnate-veined aligned porous structure along the orientation direction. The CTF was then assembled as a wearable sensor to monitor various human motions such as arm bending, squatting, tiptoeing, etc., showing good detection performances. The sensor can also deal with water pollution through oil/water separation, suggesting its multifunctionality and promising prospects in complicated situations.									108	3	0	0	10	0	109			1385-8947	1873-3212											2020-01-16	WOS:000503381200109

Conductive hydrogels are a class of soft electronic materials that have emerging applications in wearable and implantable biomedical devices. However, current conductive hydrogels possess fundamental limitations in terms of their antibacterial performance and a mechanical mismatch with human tissues, which severely limits their applications in biological interfaces. Here, inspired by animal skin, a conductive hydrogel is fabricated from a supramolecular assembly of polydopamine decorated silver nanoparticles (PDA@Ag NPs), polyaniline, and polyvinyl alcohol, namely PDA@Ag NPs/CPHs. The resultant hydrogel has many desirable features, such as tunable mechanical and electrochemical properties, eye-catching processability, good self-healing ability as well as repeatable adhesiveness. Remarkably, PDA@Ag NPs/CPHs exhibit broad antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The potential application of this versatile hydrogel is demonstrated by monitoring large-scale movements of the human body in real time. In addition, PDA@Ag NPs/CPHs have a significant therapeutic effect on diabetic foot wounds by promoting angiogenesis, accelerating collagen deposition, inhibiting bacterial growth, and controlling wound infection. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that conductive hydrogels with antibacterial ability are developed for use as epidermal sensors and diabetic foot wound dressing.									290	15	0	0	89	0	295			1616-301X	1616-3028											2019-08-13	WOS:000477977100002

However, such instant adhesion is challenging when wet surfaces such as body tissues are involved, because water separates the molecules of the two surfaces, preventing interactions(3,4). Although tissue adhesives have potential advantages over suturing or stapling(5,6), existing liquid or hydrogel tissue adhesives suffer from several limitations: weak bonding, low biological compatibility, poor mechanical match with tissues, and slow adhesion formation(5-13). Here we propose an alternative tissue adhesive in the form of a dry double-sided tape (DST) made from a combination of a biopolymer (gelatin or chitosan) and crosslinked poly(acrylic acid) grafted with N-hydrosuccinimide ester. The adhesion mechanism of this DST relies on the removal of interfacial water from the tissue surface, resulting in fast temporary crosslinking to the surface. Subsequent covalent crosslinking with amine groups on the tissue surface further improves the adhesion stability and strength of the DST. In vitro mouse, in vivo rat and ex vivo porcine models show that the DST can achieve strong adhesion between diverse wet dynamic tissues and engineering solids within five seconds. The DST may be useful as a tissue adhesive and sealant, and in adhering wearable and implantable devices to wet tissues.									535	32	0	0	114	0	547			0028-0836	1476-4687											2019-11-07	WOS:000496159900056	31666696

This systematic review evaluates current evidence and the future potential of their use in sport performance evaluation. Articles published in English (April 2017) were searched in Web-of-Science, Scopus, Pubmed, and Sport-Discus databases. A keyword search of titles, abstracts and keywords which included studies using accelerometers, gyroscopes and/or magnetometers to analyse sport motor-tasks performed by athletes (excluding risk of injury, physical activity, and energy expenditure) resulted in 2040 papers. Papers and reference list screening led to the selection of 286 studies and 23 reviews. Information on sport, motor-tasks, participants, device characteristics, sensor position and fixing, experimental setting and performance indicators was extracted. The selected papers dealt with motor capacity assessment (51 papers), technique analysis (163), activity classification (19), and physical demands assessment (61). Focus was placed mainly on elite and sub-elite athletes (59%) performing their sport in-field during training (62%) and competition (7%). Measuring movement outdoors created opportunities in winter sports (8%), water sports (16%), team sports (25%), and other outdoor activities (27%). Indications on the reliability of sensor-based performance indicators are provided, together with critical considerations and future trends.									241	0	0	0	35	1	242				1424-8220											2018-03-01	WOS:000428805300194	29543747

However, it is still a challenge to prepare flexible composite films with desirable properties. Herein, the flexible multilayered MXene/thermoplastic polyurethane films were prepared via a simple layer-by-layer spraying technique. The multilayered films with 28.6 wt% MXene and 52-mu m thickness exhibit high electrical conductivity of 1600 S/m, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness of 50.7 dB in the X-band, and outstanding specific shielding effectiveness of 7276 dB.cm(2) g(-1). Meanwhile, a high in-plane thermal conductivity of 6.31 W/(m.k) and low cross-plane thermal conductivity of 0.42 W/(m.k) were obtained. Besides, the obtained films exhibit excellent Joule heating performance (113 degrees C) with low voltage (5 V), fast response time (< 10 s), excellent heating stability, and efficient de-icing as well as potential thermal stealth performance.									168	15	0	0	13	0	169			2522-0128	2522-0136											2021-03-21	WOS:000624389000001

Sensitivity and linearity are the two most essential parameters for pressure sensors. Although various designed micro/nanostructure morphologies have been introduced, the trade-off between sensitivity and linearity has not been well balanced. Human skin, which contains force receptors in a reticular layer, has a high sensitivity even for large external stimuli. Herein, inspired by the skin epidermis with high-performance force sensing, we have proposed a special surface morphology spinosum microstructure of random distribution via the combination of an abrasive paper template and reduced graphene oxide. The sensitivity of the graphene pressure sensor with random distribution spinosum (RDS) microstructure is as high as 25.1 kPa(-1) in a wide linearity range of 0-2.6 kPa. Our pressure sensor exhibits superior comprehensive properties compared with previous surface-modified pressure sensors. According to simulation and mechanism analyses, the spinosum microstructure and random distribution contribute to the high sensitivity and large linearity range, respectively. In addition, the pressure sensor shows promising potential in detecting human physiological signals, such as heartbeat, respiration, phonation, and human motions of a pushup, arm bending, and walking. The wearable pressure sensor array was further used to detect gait states of supination, neutral, and pronation. The RDS microstructure provides an alternative strategy to improve the performance of pressure sensors and extend their potential applications in monitoring human activities.									436	28	0	0	23	0	447			1936-0851	1936-086X											2018-03-01	WOS:000428972600026	29378401

Using this approach, insulating matrix and conductive electrode inks are directly printed in specific layouts. Passive and active electrical components are then integrated to produce the desired electronic circuitry by using an empty nozzle (in vacuum-on mode) to pick up individual components, place them onto the substrate, and then deposit them (in vacuum-off mode) in the desired location. The components are then interconnected via printed conductive traces to yield soft electronic devices that may find potential application in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and biomedical devices.									400	11	0	0	25	0	405			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-10-25	WOS:000413406200025	28875572

An electronic synapse functionalized with an artificial sensory receptor and an artificial motor unit can be a fundamental element of bioinspired soft electronics. Here, we report an organic optoelectronic sensorimotor synapse that uses an organic optoelectronic synapse and a neuromuscular system based on a stretchable organic nanowire synaptic transistor (s-ONWST). The voltage pulses of a self-powered photodetector triggered by optical signals drive the s-ONWST, and resultant informative synaptic outputs are used not only for optical wireless communication of human-machine interfaces but also for light-interactive actuation of an artificial muscle actuator in the same way that a biological muscle fiber contracts. Our organic optoelectronic sensorimotor synapse suggests a promising strategy toward developing bioinspired soft electronics, neurologically inspired robotics, and electronic prostheses.									268	14	0	0	19	0	273			2375-2548												2018-11-01	WOS:000452212000019	30480091

The recent boom in electronic devices with different functions in transparent LED displays, stretchable electronic systems and artificial skin has increased the demand for supercapacitors to move towards light, thin, integrated macro- and micro devices with transparent, flexible, stretchable, compressible and/or wearable abilities. The successful fabrication of such supercapacitors depends mainly on the preparation of innovative electrode materials and the design of unconventional supercapacitor configurations. Tremendous research efforts have been recently made to design and construct innovative nanocarbon-based electrode materials and supercapacitors with unconventional configurations. We review here recent developments in supercapacitors from nanocarbon-based electrode materials to device configurations. The advances in nanocarbon-based electrode materials mainly include the assembly technologies of macroscopic nanostructured electrodes with different dimensions of carbon nanotubes/nanofibers, graphene, mesoporous carbon, activated carbon, and their composites. The electrodes with macroscopic nanostructured carbon-based materials overcome the issues of low conductivity, poor mechanical properties, and limited dimensions that are faced by conventional methods. The configurational design of advanced supercapacitor devices is presented with six types of unconventional supercapacitor devices: flexible, micro-, stretchable, compressible, transparent and fiber supercapacitors. Such supercapacitors display unique configurations and excellent electrochemical performance at different states such as bending, stretching, compressing and/or folding. For example, all-solid-state simplified supercapacitors that are based on nanostructured graphene composite paper are able to maintain 95% of the original capacity at a 180 folding state. The progress made so far will guide further developments in the structural design of nanocarbon-based electrode materials and the configurational diversity of supercapacitor devices. Future developments and prospects in the controllable assembly of macroscopic nanostructured electrodes and the innovation of unconventional supercapacitor configurations are also discussed. This should shed light on the R&D of supercapacitors.									434	38	0	0	13	0	437			0306-0012	1460-4744											2016-08-07	WOS:000381328200010	27263796

The relevant thermal properties of humans measured at different ambient conditions are reported. Several thermopiles are either attached with a strap directly to the skin or integrated into garments in different locations on human body, and power generation is extensively studied at different ambient conditions. Textile covering thermopiles is found not to essentially decrease power generation. Therefore, a hidden energy harvester is integrated into an office-style shirt and tested on people in real life. It generated power in 5-0.5 mW range at ambient temperatures of 15 degrees C-27 degrees C, respectively. The thermoelectric shirt with such an energy harvester produces more energy during nine months of use (if worn 10 h/day) than the energy stored in alkaline batteries of the same thickness and weight.									274	8	1	0	8	1	289			1530-437X	1558-1748											2013-06-12	WOS:000318707300013

In this work, a self-powered flexible humidity sensing device based on poly(vinyl alcohol)/Ti3C2Tx (PVA/MXene) nanofibers film and monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) was reported for the first time. The monolayer MoSe2-based PENG was fabricated by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition techniques, which can generate a peak output of 35 mV and a power density of 42 mW m(-2). The flexible PENG integrated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate can harvest energy generated by different parts of human body and exhibit great application prospects in wearable devices. The electrospinned PVA/MXene nanofiber-based humidity sensor with flexible PET substrate under the driven of monolayer MoSe2 PENG, shows high response of similar to 40, fast response/recovery time of 0.9/6.3 s, low hysteresis of 1.8% and excellent repeatability. The self-powered flexible humidity sensor yields the capability of detecting human skin moisture and ambient humidity. This work provides a pathway to explore the high-performance humidity sensor integrated with PENG for the self-powered flexible electronic devices.									171	7	0	0	12	0	170			2311-6706	2150-5551											2021-02-09	WOS:000609817400002	34138242

Supercapacitors and batteries have been considered to be the most promising energy/power sources for wearable electronics; however, they need to be electrochemically sustainable and mechanically robust. Electrically conductive hydrogels (ECHs), combining the electrical properties of conductive materials with the unique features of hydrogels, are ideal frameworks to design and construct flexible supercapacitors and batteries. ECHs are intrinsically flexible to sustain large mechanical deformation; they can hold a large amount of electrolyte solution in a 3D nanostructured conducting network, providing an extremely high surface area for the required electrochemical reactions. To date, nanostructured three-dimensional ECHs have exhibited high performance when applied as active electrode materials for supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. Future research may attempt to develop functional ECHs with controllable size, composition, morphology, and interface. This review summarizes the material design and synthetic approach of ECHs, demonstrating the advances of percolation theory in ECH materials, and subsequently presents their effective application in flexible energy storage systems and discusses the challenges and opportunities in this field.

Conventional sensors usually require an external power supply, with limitations such as limited lifetime and high maintenance cost. As a newly developed mechanical energy harvesting and self-powered sensing technology, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) shows great potential to overcome these limitations. Most importantly, TENGs can be fabricated using wood, paper, fibers, and polymers, which are the most frequently used materials for sports. Recent progress on the development of TENGs for the field of intelligent sports is summarized. First, the working mechanism of TENG and its association with athletic big data are introduced. Subsequently, the development of TENG-based sports sensing systems, including smart sports facilities and wearable equipment is highlighted.

The purpose of this study was to determine the convergent validity of a selection of consumer-level accelerometer-based activity monitors.Methods: 21 healthy adults wore seven consumer-level activity monitors (Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip, Jawbone UP, Misfit Shine, Nike Fuelband, Striiv Smart Pedometer and Withings Pulse) and two research-grade accelerometers/multi-sensor devices (BodyMedia SenseWear, and ActiGraph GT3X+) for 48-hours. Participants went about their daily life in free-living conditions during data collection. The validity of the consumer-level activity monitors relative to the research devices for step count, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sleep and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) was quantified using Bland-Altman analysis, median absolute difference and Pearson's correlation.Results: All consumer-level activity monitors correlated strongly (r > 0.8) with research-grade devices for step count and sleep time, but only moderately-to-strongly for TDEE (r = 0.74-0.81) and MVPA (r = 0.52-0.91). Median absolute differences were generally modest for sleep and steps (<10% of research device mean values for the majority of devices) moderate for TDEE (<30% of research device mean values), and large for MVPA (26-298%). Across the constructs examined, the Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip and Withings Pulse performed most strongly.Conclusions: In free-living conditions, the consumer-level activity monitors showed strong validity for the measurement of steps and sleep duration, and moderate valid for measurement of TDEE and MVPA. Validity for each construct ranged widely between devices, with the Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip and Withings Pulse being the strongest performers.									315	2	0	0	76	1	319			1479-5868												2015-03-27	WOS:000353758800001	25890168

Taking their large power density, cyclic stability, and outstanding mechanical integrity completeness into account, flexible supercapacitors are being used as energy storage devices at a wide interval. In the past few years, researchers have devoted considerable energy to promoting different kinds of transition metal oxides (TMOs) to employ in supercapacitors. Their choice can be found in unique TMOs characteristics such as ideal capacitive performance, low cost, and environment friendly. Their charge storage mechanisms obey from pseudocapacitance behavior. In the present document, we aim to provide a brief collection of the latest outcomes about several electrode materials of flexible supercapacitors based on TMOs and present this review by categories. The most popular routes to produce TMOs-based electrode materials, and the typical fabrication techniques for flexible devices, are thoroughly discussed. To add, since there is a tight connection between the morphology of the electrode materials and the electrochemical performance, the evaluation of the electrode component effect on the mechanical flexibility of the fabricated devices is a necessity. Not far ago for making accurate predictions about the upcoming trends towards the comprehension of an ultimate-performance, TMOs-based flexible supercapacitors, a history of the throughout electrochemical nobles and current evolution of the reported devices has been reported.

In addition, these devices possess powerful computation and communication capabilities and are equipped with various built-in functional sensors. The large quantity and advanced functionalities of mobile devices have created a new interface between human beings and environments. Many mobile crowd sensing applications have thus been designed which recruit normal users to contribute their resources for sensing tasks. To guarantee good performance of such applications, it's essential to recruit sufficient participants. Thus, how to effectively and efficiently motivate normal users draws growing attention in the research community. This paper surveys diverse strategies that are proposed in the literature to provide incentives for stimulating users to participate in mobile crowd sensing applications. The incentives are divided into three categories: entertainment, service, and money. Entertainment means that sensing tasks are turned into playable games to attract participants. Incentives of service exchanging are inspired by the principle of mutual benefits. Monetary incentives give participants payments for their contributions. We describe literature works of each type comprehensively and summarize them in a compact form. Further challenges and promising future directions concerning incentive mechanism design are also discussed.									319	12	0	0	3	0	327			1553-877X												2016-01-01	WOS:000370521600004

Natural evolution has resulted in organisms which have excellent thermoregulation capabilities in extreme climates. Bioinspired materials that mimic biological solution for thermoregulation have proven promising for passive radiative cooling. However, scalable production of artificial photonic radiators with complex structures, outstanding properties, high throughput, and low cost is still challenging. Herein, we design and demonstrate biologically inspired photonic materials for passive radiative cooling, after discovery of longicorn beetles' excellent thermoregulatory function with their dual-scale fluffs. The natural fluffs exhibit a finely structured triangular cross-section with two thermoregulatory effects which effectively reflects sunlight and emits thermal radiation, thereby decreasing the beetles' body temperature. Inspired by the finding, a photonic film consisting of a micropyramid-arrayed polymer matrix with random ceramic particles is fabricated with high throughput. The film reflects similar to 95% of solar irradiance and exhibits an infrared emissivity >0.96. The effective cooling power is found to be similar to 90.8 W center dot m(-2) and a temperature decrease of up to 5.1 degrees C is recorded under direct sunlight. Additionally, the film exhibits hydrophobicity, superior flexibility, and strong mechanical strength, which is promising for thermal management in various electronic devices and wearable products. Our work paves the way for designing and fabrication of high-performance thermal regulation materials.									141	11	0	0	12	0	150			0027-8424												2020-07-27	WOS:000548159300011	32541048

The popularization of traffic-intensive applications including high definition video, 3-D visualization, augmented reality, wearable devices, and cloud computing defines a new era of mobile communications. The immense amount of traffic generated by today's customers requires a paradigm shift in all aspects of mobile networks. Ultradense network (UDN) is one of the leading ideas in this racetrack. In UDNs, the access nodes and/or the number of communication links per unit area are densified. In this paper, we provide a survey-style introduction to dense small cell networks. Moreover, we summarize and compare some of the recent achievements and research findings. We discuss the modeling techniques and the performance metrics widely used to model problems in UDN. Also, we present the enabling technologies for network densification in order to understand the state-of-the-art. We consider many research directions in this survey, namely, user association, interference management, energy efficiency, spectrum sharing, resource management, scheduling, backhauling, propagation modeling, and the economics of UDN deployment.

Nevertheless, most sensors' complex structural design, monotonous parameter detection capability, and single information coding communication hinder their rapid development. As the frontier of self-powered sensors, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has multiple working modes and high structural adaptability, which is a potential solution for multi-parameter sensing and miniaturizing of traditional interactive electronic devices. Herein, a self-powered hybrid coder (SHC) based on TENG is reported to encode two action parameters of touch and press, which can be used as a smart interface for human-machine interaction. The top-down hollow structure of the SHC, not only constructs a compositing mode to generate stable touch and press signals but also builds a hybrid coding platform for generating action codes in synergy mode. When a finger touches or presses the SHC, Morse code and Gray code can be transmitted for text information or remote control of electric devices. This self-powered coder is of reference value for designing an alternative human-machine interface and having the potential to contribute to the next generation of highly integrated portable smart electronics.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			2366-9608												2022-02-07	WOS:000749664800001	35084114

The shape-adaptive MG-TENG relies on sliding electrification between complementary micro-sized arrays of linear grating, which offers a unique and straightforward solution in harnessing energy from relative sliding motion between surfaces. Operating at a sliding velocity of 10 m/s, a MG-TENG of 60 cm(2) in overall area, 0.2 cm(3) in volume and 0.6 g in weight can deliver an average output power of 3 W (power density of similar to 50 mW cm(-2) and 15 W cm(-3)) at an overall conversion efficiency of similar to 50%, making it a sufficient power supply to regular electronics, such as light bulbs. The scalable and cost-effective MG-TENG is practically applicable in not only harvesting various mechanical motions but also possibly power generation at a large scale.									358	24	1	0	11	0	368			0935-9648	1521-4095											2014-06-18	WOS:000337618600001	24692147

Electrochromic devices generally consist of multilayer structures with transparent conductors, electrochromic films, ion conductors, and ion storage films. Synthetic strategies and new materials for electrochromic films and transparent conductors, comprehensive electrochemical kinetic analysis, and novel device design are areas of active study worldwide. These are believed to be the key factors that will help to significantly improve the electrochromic performance and extend their application areas. In this Account, we present our strategies to design and fabricate electrochromic devices with high performance and multifunctionality. We first describe the synthetic strategies, in which a porous tungsten oxide (W0(3)) film with nearly ideal optical modulation and fast switching was prepared by a pulsed electrochemical deposition method. Multiple strategies, such as sol-gel/inkjet printing methods, hydrothermal/inkjet printing methods, and a novel hybrid transparent conductor/electrochromic layer have been developed to prepare high-performance electrochromic films. We then summarize the recent advances in transparent conductors and ion conductor layers, which play critial roles in electrochromic devices. Benefiting from the developments of soft transparent conductive substrates, highly deformable electrochromic devices that are flexible, foldable, stretchable, and wearable have been achieved. These emerging devices have great potential in applications such as soft displays, electrochromic e-skins, deformable electrochromic films, and so on. We finally present a concept of multifunctional smart glass, which can change its color to dynamically adjust the daylight and solar heat input of the building or protect the users' privacy during the daytime. Energy can also be stored in the smart windows during the daytime simultaneously and be discharged for use in the evening. These results reveal that the electrochromic devices have potential applications in a wide range of areas. We hope that this Account will promote further efforts toward fundamental research on electrochromic materials and the development of new multifunctional electrochromic devices to meet the growing demands for next-generation electronic systems.									412	11	0	0	14	0	414			0001-4842	1520-4898											2016-08-01	WOS:000381654700003	27404116

Traditional fabrication techniques have limitations in controlling the geometry and architecture of the electrode and solid-state electrolytes, which would otherwise compromise the performance. 3D printing, a disruptive manufacturing technology, has emerged as an innovative approach to fabricating EES devices from nanoscale to macroscale, providing great opportunities to accurately control device geometry (e.g., dimension, porosity, and morphology) and structure with enhanced specific energy and power densities. Moreover, the "additive" manufacturing nature of 3D printing provides excellent controllability of the electrode thickness with much simplified process in a cost effective manner. With the unique spatial and temporal material manipulation capability, 3D printing can integrate multiple nano-materials in the same print, and multi-functional EES devices (including functional gradient devices) can be fabricated. Herein, we review recent advances in 3D printing of EES devices. We focus on two major 3D printing technologies including direct writing and inkjet printing. The direct material deposition characteristics of these two processes enable them to print on a variety of flat substrates, even a conformal one, well suiting them to applications such as wearable devices and on-chip integrations. Other potential 3D printing techniques such as freeze nano-printing, stereolithography, fused deposition modeling, binder jetting, laminated object manufacturing, and metal 3D printing are also introduced. The advantages and limitations of each 3D printing technology are extensively discussed. More importantly, we provide a perspective on how to integrate the emerging 3D printing with existing technologies to create structures over multiple length scale from nano to macro for EES applications.									272	20	0	0	11	0	276			2211-2855	2211-3282											2017-10-01	WOS:000411687800048

It still remains a great challenge to develop flexible and stretchable CNCs for high performance WSSs that possess a high sensitivity, large working strain and can also be applied in various harsh conditions such as extremely cold and corrosive environment. Here, we propose a facile strategy for preparation of superhydrophobic and multi-functional CNCs with a dual conducive network by sequential decoration of acid modified carbon nanotubes (ACNTs), Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) onto the elastic thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) nanofiber surface. The introduction of ACNTs, AgNPs and PDMS significantly improves the Young's modulus and tensile strength while maintaining the superelasticity of the TPU nanofibrous membrane. The multi-functional CNCs possess high conductivity (up to 3031.5 S/m) and thus the excellent electro-thermal effect and deicing performance. The CNC based strain sensor possesses an extremely large gauge factor of 1.04 x 10(5) (with the strain ranging from 20% to 70%), which is the highest value ever reported for the CNC strain sensors. Thanks to the high sensitivity, the sensor can be used to monitor and distinguish various body motions including large and subtle human joint movement even in a corrosive condition. The superhydrophobic and multi-functional CNC has potential application prospects in water proof wearable electronics and heaters.									115	10	0	0	14	0	118			1385-8947	1873-3212											2020-04-01	WOS:000507465200050

Herein, a novel strategy for the growth of nickel-cobalt bisulfide (NiCoS) nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth (CC) as supercapacitor electrodes is reported, involving deposition of two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors on the CC skeletons, conversion of MOF into nickel-cobalt layered double-hydroxide by ion exchange process and formation of NiCoS by a sulfidation treatment. The NiCoS nanosheets with rough surface and porous structures are uniformly anchored on the CC skeletons. The unique architecture endows the composite (NiCoS/CC) with abundant accessible active sites. Besides, robust electrical/mechanical joint between the nanosheets and the substrates is attained, leading to the improved electrochemical performance. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor device is constructed by using NiCoS/CC and activated carbon as a positive electrode and a negative electrode, respectively. The optimized device exhibits a high specific capacitance, large energy density and long cycle life. The NiCoS/CC electrode with intriguing electrochemical properties and mechanical flexibility holds great prospect for next-generation wearable devices.

The design and fabrication of a flexible and robust electrode based on cobalt sulfide/reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (CoS2/RGO-CNT) nanocomposites are reported. An efficient hydrothermal process combined with vacuum filtration was used to synthesize such composite architecture, which was then embedded in a porous CNT network. This conductive and robust film is evaluated as electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergistic effect of CoS2, graphene, and CNTs leads to unique CoS2/RGO-CNT nanoarchitectures, the HER activity of which is among the highest for non-noble metal electrocatalysts, showing 10mAcm(-2) current density at about 142mV overpotentials and a high electrochemical stability.									463	29	0	0	17	0	469			1433-7851	1521-3773											2014-11-10	WOS:000344649900043	25297454

In particular, the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is becoming increasingly important in human activity recognition (HAR) due to the rapid development of wearable and mobile devices. In this article, we focus on the deep-learning-enhanced HAR in IoHT environments. A semisupervised deep learning framework is designed and built for more accurate HAR, which efficiently uses and analyzes the weakly labeled sensor data to train the classifier learning model. To better solve the problem of the inadequately labeled sample, an intelligent autolabeling scheme based on deep Q-network (DQN) is developed with a newly designed distance-based reward rule which can improve the learning efficiency in IoT environments. A multisensor based data fusion mechanism is then developed to seamlessly integrate the on-body sensor data, context sensor data, and personal profile data together, and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based classification method is proposed to identify fine-grained patterns according to the high-level features contextually extracted from the sequential motion data. Finally, experiments and evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method using real-world data.									158	2	0	0	5	0	160			2327-4662												2020-07-28	WOS:000548817900066

In this work, a triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (HNG) driven by tires was developed for self-powered gas and movement monitoring. The output performance of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG) increases with increasing vehicle speed, and the voltages of the TENG and EMG are 581 V and 62 V at the 15 km/h vehicle speed, respectively. The HNG can turn on a light (3 W) and charge a smartphone. A Ti3C2Tx MXene/Ag-based sensor driven by HNG was fabricated for ethanol detection. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and bulk electrosensitive measurements show that MXene/Ag nanocomposites have excellent sensitivity to ethanol. The high response(Delta Uab/Uab(gas) = 204% @ 100 ppm) of the self-powered ethanol sensor is 24.5 times larger than that of the resistive sensor (Delta R/Ra = 8.3%). The self-powered sensor could be used to assess the levels of drinking and ensure cyclists ride safely. MXene/Ag-based flexible sensors were fabricated using a microelectronic printer and electrospinning apparatus to monitor articular activity. The self-powered monitor system can be used to access the motion data of cyclists and provide cyclists with better training and race strategies.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212											2022-06-22	WOS:000806495800001

We design a "trihigh tricontinuous" (3H3C) graphene film cathode with features of high quality, orientation, and channeling for local structures (3H) and continuous electron-conducting matrix, ion-diffusion highway, and electroactivemass for the whole electrode (3C). Such a cathode retains high specific capacity of around 120 mAh g(-1) at ultrahigh current density of 400 A g(-1) (charged in 1.1 s) with 91.7% retention after 250,000 cycles, surpassing all the previous batteries in terms of rate capability and cycle life. The assembled aluminum-graphene battery works well within a wide temperature range of -40 to 120 degrees C with remarkable flexibility bearing 10,000 times of folding, promising for all-climate wearable energy devices.

Technology enhanced solutions such as mobile applications, activity monitors, prompting software, texts, emails and websites are being harnessed to reduce SB. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of such technology enhanced interventions aimed at reducing SB in healthy adults and to examine the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used.Methods: Five electronic databases were searched to identify randomised-controlled trials (RCTs), published up to June 2016. Interventions using computer, mobile or wearable technologies to facilitate a reduction in SB, using a measure of sedentary time as an outcome, were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and interventions were coded using the BCT Taxonomy (v1).Results: Meta-analysis of 15/17 RCTs suggested that computer, mobile and wearable technology tools resulted in a mean reduction of -41.28 min per day (min/day) of sitting time (95% CI -60.99, -21.58, I2 = 77%, n = 1402), in favour of the intervention group at end point follow-up. The pooled effects showed mean reductions at short (<= 3 months), medium (> 3 to 6 months), and long-term follow-up (> 6 months) of -42.42 min/day, -37.23 min/day and -1.65 min/day, respectively. Overall, 16/17 studies were deemed as having a high or unclear risk of bias, and 1/17 was judged to be at a low risk of bias. A total of 46 BCTs (14 unique) were coded for the computer, mobile and wearable components of the interventions. The most frequently coded were "prompts and cues", "self-monitoring of behaviour", "social support (unspecified)" and "goal setting (behaviour)".Conclusion: Interventions using computer, mobile and wearable technologies can be effective in reducing SB. Effectiveness appeared most prominent in the short-term and lessened over time. A range of BCTs have been implemented in these interventions. Future studies need to improve reporting of BCTs within interventions and address the methodological flaws identified within the review through the use of more rigorously controlled study designs with longer-term follow-ups, objective measures of SB and the incorporation of strategies to reduce attrition.									136	0	0	0	22	1	137				1479-5868											2017-08-30	WOS:000407946300001	28800736

Currently available bioelectronics generally rely on external aids to form an attachment to the human body, which leads to unstable performance in practical applications. Self-adhesive bioelectronics are highly desirable for ameliorating these concerns by offering reliable and conformal contact with tissue, and stability and fidelity in the signal detection. However, achieving adequate and long-term self-adhesion to soft and wet biological tissues has been a daunting challenge. Recently, mussel-inspired hydrogels have emerged as promising candidates for the design of self-adhesive bioelectronics. In addition to self-adhesiveness, the mussel-inspired chemistry offers a unique pathway for integrating multiple functional properties to all-in-one bioelectronic devices, which have great implications for healthcare applications.

This paper presents a simple piezoelectric spring architecture based on a common binder clip structure. The harvester with pendulum spring allows the energy of the dynamic mass to be converted into electrical energy in the piezoelectric transducer. Due to the basic characteristics of spring pendulums, the proposed harvester can efficiently scavenge not only ultra-low frequency but also multi-directional vibrational energies. Modeling and design are conducted and a normalized expression of the harvester behavior is given. Chirp and human motion excitations are used to evaluate the proposed harvester's performances. Simulation and experimental results are in good agreement. The proposed device could generate a high output power (13.29 mW) at a low operating frequency (2.03 Hz), which shows great application prospects in the power supply of wearable products, ocean buoys, etc.									159	17	0	0	2	0	172			0306-2619	1872-9118											2018-12-28	WOS:000452345400046

To avoid stress-inducing blood sampling and to realize continuous, non-invasive, and real-time stress analysis at the molecular levels, we investigate the dynamics of a stress hormone, cortisol, in human sweat using an integrated wireless sensing device. Highly sensitive, selective, and efficient cortisol sensing is enabled by a flexible sensor array that exploits the exceptional performance of laser-induced graphene for electrochemical sensing. Here, we report the first cortisol diurnal cycle and the dynamic stress-response profile constructed from human sweat. Our pilot study demonstrates a strong empirical correlation between serum and sweat cortisol, revealing exciting opportunities offered by sweat analysis toward non-invasive dynamic stress monitoring via wearable and portable sensing platforms.									164	7	0	0	39	0	165			2590-2393	2590-2385											2020-04-01	WOS:000522913200017	32266329

Despite recent progress, current magnetic programming approaches are inherently coupled to sequential fabrication processes, preventing reprogrammability and high-throughput programming. Here, we report a high-throughput magnetic programming strategy based on heating magnetic soft materials above the Curie temperature of the embedded ferromagnetic particles and reorienting their magnetic domains by applying magnetic fields during cooling. We demonstrate discrete, three-dimensional, and reprogrammable magnetization with high spatial resolution (similar to 38 mu m). Using the reprogrammable magnetization capability, reconfigurable mechanical behavior of an auxetic metamaterial structure, tunable locomotion of a surface-walking soft robot, and adaptive grasping of a soft gripper are shown. Our approach further enables high-throughput magnetic programming (up to 10 samples/min) via contact transfer. Heat-assisted magnetic programming strategy described here establishes a rich design space and mass-manufacturing capability for development of multiscale and reprogrammable soft machines.									138	4	0	0	8	0	139			2375-2548												2020-10-15	WOS:000574597200035	32948594

However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa(-1)), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring of intelligent robot motion in real time.									242	25	0	0	20	0	248			1936-0851	1936-086X											2020-02-01	WOS:000518024700082	32040310

Unique one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 2D graphene (CNT/G) hybrid fibers with a large surface area and high electrical conductivity have been achieved by pre-intercalating graphene fibers with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for subsequent CVD growth of CNTs. The CNT/G hybrid fibers can be further woven into textile electrodes for the construction of flexible supercapacitors with a high tolerance to the repeated bending cycles. Various other applications, such as catalysis, separation, and adsorption, can be envisioned for the CNT/G hybrid fibers.									282	27	0	0	16	0	296			2040-3364	2040-3372											2013-01-01	WOS:000316959500044	23475309

Drawing on inspiration from nature, nacre has demonstrated outstanding mechanical properties, especially combining high strength and toughness, which is due in part to its delicate hierarchical layered architecture with rich interfacial interactions. We demonstrate that strain sensors based on this nacre-mimetic microscale "brick-and-mortar" architecture can simultaneously achieve ultrahigh sensitivity and large stretchability while performing well in linearity, reliability, long-term durability, and monotonicity. The bioinspired sensor demonstrated a gauge factor >200 over a range of working strains up to 83% and achieved a high gauge factor exceeding 8700 in the strain region of 76-83%. This successful combination of high sensitivity and large stretchability is attributed to (1) the microscale hierarchical architecture derived from the amalgamation of 2D titanium carbide (MXene) Ti3C2Tx/1D silver nanowire "brick" and poly(dopamine)/Ni2+ "mortar" and (2) the synergistic toughing effects from interfacial interactions of hydrogen and coordination bonding, layer slippage, and molecular chain stretching. The synergistic behavior of the "brick" and "mortar" allows for controlled crack generation for high sensitivity but can also dissipate considerable loading energy to promote the stepwise propagation of cracks while stretching, guaranteeing the significant comprehensive sensing performance. Moreover, this bioinspired strain sensor is employed to monitor human activities under different motion states to demonstrate its feasibility for wearable, full-spectrum human health and motion monitoring systems.									256	22	0	0	22	0	264			1936-0851	1936-086X											2019-01-01	WOS:000456749900066	30566329

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence for validity and reliability of popular consumer-wearable activity trackers (Fitbit and Jawbone) and their ability to estimate steps, distance, physical activity, energy expenditure, and sleep.Methods: Searches included only full-length English language studies published in PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar through July 31, 2015. Two people reviewed and abstracted each included study.Results: In total, 22 studies were included in the review (20 on adults, 2 on youth). For laboratory-based studies using step counting or accelerometer steps, the correlation with tracker-assessed steps was high for both Fitbit and Jawbone (Pearson or intraclass correlation coefficients (CC) > = 0.80). Only one study assessed distance for the Fitbit, finding an over-estimate at slower speeds and under-estimate at faster speeds. Two field-based studies compared accelerometry-assessed physical activity to the trackers, with one study finding higher correlation (Spearman CC 0.86, Fitbit) while another study found a wide range in correlation (intraclass CC 0.36-0.70, Fitbit and Jawbone). Using several different comparison measures (indirect and direct calorimetry, accelerometry, self-report), energy expenditure was more often under-estimated by either tracker. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were overestimated and wake after sleep onset was under-estimated comparing metrics from polysomnography to either tracker using a normal mode setting. No studies of intradevice reliability were found. Interdevice reliability was reported on seven studies using the Fitbit, but none for the Jawbone. Walking-and running-based Fitbit trials indicated consistently high interdevice reliability for steps (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.76-1.00), distance (intraclass CC 0.90-0.99), and energy expenditure (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.71-0.97). When wearing two Fitbits while sleeping, consistency between the devices was high.Conclusion: This systematic review indicated higher validity of steps, few studies on distance and physical activity, and lower validity for energy expenditure and sleep. The evidence reviewed indicated high interdevice reliability for steps, distance, energy expenditure, and sleep for certain Fitbit models. As new activity trackers and features are introduced to the market, documentation of the measurement properties can guide their use in research settings.									242	2	0	0	42	0	243				1479-5868											2015-12-18	WOS:000366819600001	26684758

Gas sensors based on conventional bulk materials often suffer from their poor surface-sensitive sites, leading to a very low gas adsorption ability. Moreover, the charge transportation efficiency is usually inhibited by the low defect density of surface-sensitive area than that in the interior. In this work, a gas sensing structure model based on CuS quantum dots/Bi2S3 nanosheets (CuS QDs/Bi2S3 NSs) inspired by artificial neuron network is constructed. Simulation analysis by density functional calculation revealed that CuS QDs and Bi2S3 NSs can be used as the main adsorption sites and charge transport pathways, respectively. Thus, the high-sensitivity sensing of NO2 can be realized by designing the artificial neuron-like sensor. The experimental results showed that the CuS QDs with a size of about 8 nm are highly adsorbable, which can enhance the NO2 sensitivity due to the rich sensitive sites and quantum size effect. The Bi2S3 NSs can be used as a charge transfer network channel to achieve efficient charge collection and transmission. The neuron-like sensor that simulates biological smell shows a significantly enhanced response value (3.4), excellent responsiveness (18 s) and recovery rate (338 s), low theoretical detection limit of 78 ppb, and excellent selectivity for NO2. Furthermore, the developed wearable device can also realize the visual detection of NO2 through real-time signal changes.									35	3	0	0	1	0	37			2311-6706	2150-5551											2021-12-10	WOS:000725606600001	34859321

The research in this field has focused on developing new intrinsically stretchable components for conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. New methodologies and fabrication processes have been developed to fabricate stretchable devices with intrinsically stretchable components. The latest successful examples of stretchable conductors for applications in interconnections, electrodes, and piezoresistive devices are reviewed here. Stretchable conductors can be used for electrode or sensor applications depending on the electrical properties of the stretchable conductors under mechanical strain. A detailed overview of the recent progress in stretchable semiconductors, stretchable insulators, and other novel stretchable materials is also given, along with a discussion of the associated technological innovations and challenges. Stretchable electronic devices with intrinsically stretchable components such as field-effect transistors (FETs), photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), electronic skins, and energy harvesters are also described and a new strategy for development of stretchable electronic devices is discussed.

We studied how these behaviors evolved during reopening the possible contributions of continued working from home and smartphone usage.Methods: Participants (N = 198) were studied through the lockdown and subsequent reopening period, using a wearable sleep/activity tracker, smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and passive smartphone usage tracking. Work/study location was obtained through daily EMA ascertainment.Results: Upon reopening, earlier, shorter sleep and increased physical activity were observed, alongside increased self-rated stress and poorer evening mood ratings. These reopening changes were affected by post-lockdown work arrangements and patterns of smartphone usage. Individuals who returned to work or school in-person tended toward larger shifts to earlier sleep and wake timings. Returning to in-person work/school also correlated with more physical activity. Contrary to expectation, there was no decrease in objectively measured smartphone usage after reopening. A cluster analysis showed that persons with relatively heavier smartphone use prior to bedtime had later sleep timings and lower physical activity.Conclusions: These observations indicate that the reopening after lockdown was accompanied by earlier sleep timing, increased physical activity, and altered mental wellbeing. Moreover, these changes were affected by work/study arrangements and smartphone usage patterns.									14	0	0	0	4	0	14			0161-8105	1550-9109											2022-03-27	WOS:000746174900017	34636396

Extensive efforts during the past decade have led to major scientific and technological innovations towards tight monitoring of diabetes. Such continued progress toward advanced continuous glucose monitoring platforms, either minimal- or non-invasive, holds considerable promise for addressing the limitations of finger-prick blood testing toward tracking glucose trends over time, optimal therapeutic interventions, and improving the life of diabetes patients. However, despite these major developments, the field of glucose biosensors is still facing major challenges. The scope of this review is to present the key scientific and technological advances in electrochemical glucose biosensing over the past decade (2010-present), along with current obstacles and prospects towards the ultimate goal of highly stable and reliable real-time minimally-invasive or non-invasive glucose monitoring. After an introduction to electrochemical glucose biosensors, we highlight recent progress based on using advanced nanomaterials at the electrode-enzyme interface of three generations of glucose sensors. Subsequently, we cover recent activity and challenges towards next-generation wearable non-invasive glucose monitoring devices based on innovative sensing principles, alternative body fluids, advanced flexible materials, and novel platforms. This is followed by highlighting the latest progress in the field of minimally-invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) which offers real-time information about interstitial glucose levels, by focusing on the challenges toward developing biocompatible membrane coatings to protect electrochemical glucose sensors against surface biofouling. Subsequent sections cover new analytical concepts of self-powered glucose sensors, paper-based glucose sensing and multiplexed detection of diabetes-related biomarkers. Finally, we will cover the latest advances in commercially available devices along with the upcoming future technologies.									275	9	0	0	52	0	278			0306-0012	1460-4744											2020-11-17	WOS:000583591400006	33020790

They are capable of producing detailed biometric data that may be collected by individuals and then shared with others. Health promoters, like many medical and public health professionals, have been eager to seize the opportunities they perceive for using what have been dubbed mHealth' (mobile health') technologies to promote the public's health. These technologies are also increasingly used by lay people outside the professional sphere of health promotion as part of voluntary self-tracking strategies (referred to by some as the quantified self'). In response to the overwhelmingly positive approach evident in the health promotion and self-tracking literature, this article adopts a critical sociological perspective to identify some of the social and cultural meanings of self-tracking practices via digital devices. Following an overview of the technologies currently available for such purposes, I move on to discuss how they may contribute to concepts of health, embodiment and identity. The discussion focuses particularly on how these technologies promote techno-utopian, enhancement and healthist discourses, and the privileging of the visual and metric in representing the body via these devices.									313	2	1	0	10	1	316			0958-1596	1469-3682											2013-12-01	WOS:000326218600002

Here, we demonstrate a flexible ferroelectric sensor with ultrahigh pressure sensitivity and linear response over an exceptionally broad pressure range based on the material and structural design of ferroelectric composites with a multilayer interlocked microdome geometry. Due to the stress concentration between interlocked microdome arrays and increased contact area in the multilayer design, the flexible ferroelectric sensors could perceive static/dynamic pressure with high sensitivity (47.7 kPa(-1), 1.3 Pa minimum detection). In addition, efficient stress distribution between stacked multilayers enables linear sensing over exceptionally broad pressure range (0.0013-353 kPa) with fast response time (20 ms) and high reliability over 5000 repetitive cycles even at an extremely high pressure of 272 kPa. Our sensor can be used to monitor diverse stimuli from a low to a high pressure range including weak gas flow, acoustic sound, wrist pulse pressure, respiration, and foot pressure with a single device.									281	14	0	0	15	0	285			1936-0851	1936-086X											2018-04-01	WOS:000431088200102	29648803

In these advanced applications, high sensing capability is an essential feature for high performance. Although surface patterning treatments and some special elastomeric interlayers have been applied to improve sensitivity, the process is complex and this inevitably raises the cost and is an obstacle to large-scale production. In the present study a simple printing process without complex patterning has been used for constructing the sensor, and an interlayer is employed comprising elastomeric composites filled with silver nanowires. By increasing the relative permittivity, er, of the composite interlayer induced by compression at high nanowire concentration, it has been possible to achieve a maximum sensitivity of 5.54 kPa(-1). The improvement in sensitivity did not sacrifice or undermine the other features of the sensor. Thanks to the silver nanowire electrodes, the sensor is flexible and stable after 200 cycles at a bending radius of 2 mm, and exhibits outstanding reproducibility without hysteresis under similar pressure pulses. The sensor has been readily integrated onto an adhesive bandage and has been successful in detecting human movements. In addition to measuring pressure in direct contact, non-contact pressures such as air flow can also be detected.									222	13	0	0	18	0	230			2040-3364	2040-3372											2015-01-01	WOS:000349473200014	25588044

This review paper introduces the development trends and perspectives of the future sensors and MEMS/NEMS. Starting from the issues of the MEMS fabrication, we introduced typical MEMS sensors for their applications in the Internet of Things (IoTs), such as MEMS physical sensor, MEMS acoustic sensor, and MEMS gas sensor. Toward the trends in intelligence and less power consumption, MEMS components including MEMS/NEMS switch, piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT), and MEMS energy harvesting were investigated to assist the future sensors, such as event-based or almost zero-power. Furthermore, MEMS rigid substrate toward NEMS flexible-based for flexibility and interface was discussed as another important development trend for next-generation wearable or multi-functional sensors. Around the issues about the big data and human-machine realization for human beings' manipulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technologies were finally realized using sensor nodes and its wave identification as future trends for various scenarios.									146	5	0	0	3	0	149				2072-666X											2020-03-04	WOS:000514309100007	31861476

Here we demonstrate the all-printable fabrication of polycrystalline nanowire-based high-performance photodetectors on flexible substrates. Systematic investigations have shown their ultra-high photoconductive gain, responsivity and detectivity up to 3.3 x 10(17) Jones. Further analysis shows that their high performance originates from the unique band-edge modulation along the nanowire axial direction, where the existence of Schottky barriers in series leads to highly suppressed dark current of the device and also gives rise to fast photoelectric response to low-intensity optical signal owing to barrier height modulation. The discovered rationale in this work can be utilized as guideline to design high-performance photodetectors with other nanomaterial systems. The developed fabrication scheme opens up possibility for future flexible and high-performance integrated optoelectronic sensor circuitry.									473	25	1	0	20	0	479			2041-1723												2014-06-01	WOS:000338836200004	24898081

On the negative side, the figure-of-merit of polymer TE materials is low, mainly owing to typical low electrical conductivity. Various efforts have been made to enhance the TE performance of organic TE materials, i.e. chemical or electrochemical doping, modification of molecular structure, and fabrication of polymer-based composites or blends, which is the simplest and most cost-effective method for modifying polymer properties. Solution-processed polymer/inorganic or organic hybrids pave the way for formulation of functional TE inks/paste which can be used to fabricate large scale cost-effective manufacturing of TE generators. In this review, we briefly summarize the TE properties of conjugated polymers, and focus on recent developments in polymer/carbon nanofillers (e.g. CNT, graphene, GO) composites and polymer/inorganic TE nanoparticles composites along with preparation methods and thermoelectric performance. Finally, we cover recent advances in the development of functional TE inks, processing techniques, and their usage in device fabrication using various printing techniques and review device output characteristics.									131	2	0	0	4	0	131			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-12-29	WOS:000595291600003

Delamination of MXene produces single-layer nanosheets with thickness of about a nanometer and lateral size of the order of micrometers. The high aspect ratio of delaminated MXene renders it promising nanofiller in multifunctional polymer nanocomposites. Herein, Ti3C2Tx MXene was mixed with either a charged polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) or an electrically neutral polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to produce Ti3C2Tx/polymer composites. The as-fabricated composites are flexible and have electrical conductivities as high as 2.2 x 10(4) S/m in the case of the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite film and 2.4 x 105 S/m for pure Ti3C2Tx films. The tensile strength of the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites was significantly enhanced compared with pure Ti3C2Tx or PVA films. The intercalation and confinement of the polymer between the MXene flakes not only increased flexibility but also enhanced cationic intercalation, offering an impressive volumetric capacitance of similar to 530 F/cm(3) for MXene/PVA-KOH composite film at 2 mV/s. To our knowledge, this study is a first, but crucial, step in exploring the potential of using MXenes in polymer-based multifunctional nanocomposites for a host of applications, such as structural components, energy storage devices, wearable electronics, electrochemical actuators, and radiofrequency shielding, to name a few.									1382	113	1	0	92	0	1431			0027-8424												2014-11-25	WOS:000345662700023	25389310	
J	Ke, Tao; Zhao, Li; Fan, Xin; Gu, Haibin								Rapid self-healing, self-adhesive, anti-freezing, moisturizing, antibacterial and multi-stimuli-responsive PVA/starch/tea polyphenol-based composite conductive organohydrogel as flexible strain sensor								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				135				199	212				10.1016/j.jmst.2022.06.032							Article	FEB 1 2023	2023	The complexity of application environment stimulates the development of wearable devices based on functional hydrogels. Among all the promising performances, self-healing and self-adhesion properties are ideal for hydrogel sensors, which can guarantee good accuracy, comfort and long service life. However, it is still a challenge to achieve simultaneous self-healing and self-adhesion in different environments (in the air, underwater and at low temperatures). Herein, a feasible new strategy was successfully carried out to prepare a starch-based composite conductive organohydrogel based on the reversible borate ester bonds formed by complexing starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/tea polyphenol (TP) with borax, and multiple hydrogen-bond interactions among PVA, starch, TP and ethylene glycol (EG). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), reduced and stabilized by TP, and MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) were introduced into the cross-linking networks to endow the resulting PBSTCE organohydrogel with considerable antibacterial property and conductivity, respectively. The organohydrogel possessed rapid self-healing (HE (self-healing efficiency) = 96.07% in 90 s, both in the air and underwater, also at -20 degrees C), considerable self-adhesion (both in the air and underwater, also at -20 degrees C), remarkable stretchability (814% of elongation), anti-freezing (-20 degrees C) and moisture-retention abilities, antibacterial activity, sensitive pH/sugar-responsiveness, and plasticity. The strain sensor formed by the PBSTCE organohydrogel can not only effectively record large-scale human motions (e.g. finger/wrist/elbow bending, walking, etc.), but also accurately capture subtle motion changes (e.g. breathing, chewing, swallowing, speaking, smiling and frowning). Moreover, the self-healed organohydrogel sensor also exhibited almost invariable mechanical, electrical and sensing behaviors. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy to construct multifunctional starch-based organo-hydrogels, and promotes their efficient, stable and eco-friendly application as flexible wearable devices.

However, the use of electrode materials faces several challenges, such as intrinsically slow kinetics and volume change upon cycling, which impede the energy output and electrochemical stability. This study presents well-aligned molybdenum dioxide@nitrogen-doped carbon (MoO2@NC) and copper cobalt sulfide (CuCo2S4) tubular nanostructures grown on flexible carbon fiber for use as electrode materials in supercapacitors. Benefiting from the chemically stable interfaces, affluent active sites, and efficient 1D electron transport, the MoO2@NC and CuCo2S4 nanostructures integrated on conductive substrates deliver excellent electrochemical performance. A flexible quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor composed of MoO2@NC as the negative electrode and CuCo2S4 as the positive electrode achieves an ultrahigh energy density of 65.1 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1) and retains a favorable energy density of 27.6 W h kg(-1) at an ultrahigh power density of 12.8 kW kg(-1). Moreover, it demonstrates good cycling performance with 90.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles and excellent mechanical flexibility by enabling 92.2% capacitance retention after 2000 bending cycles. This study provides an effective strategy to develop electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance for flexible supercapacitors.									142	7	0	0	8	0	142				2198-3844											2018-10-01	WOS:000447632000009	30356947

Here, highly stretchable conductive fiber composed of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) embedded in a styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) elastomeric matrix is fabricated. An AgNW-embedded SBS fiber is fabricated by a simple wet spinning method. Then, the AgNPs are formed on both the surface and inner region of the AgNW-embedded fiber via repeated cycles of silver precursor absorption and reduction processes. The AgNW-embedded conductive fiber exhibits superior initial electrical conductivity (sigma(0) = 2450 S cm(-1)) and elongation at break (900% strain) due to the high weight percentage of the conductive fillers and the use of a highly stretchable SBS elastomer matrix. During the stretching, the embedded AgNWs act as conducting bridges between AgNPs, resulting in the preservation of electrical conductivity under high strain (the rate of conductivity degradation, sigma/sigma(0) = 4.4% at 100% strain). The AgNW-embedded conductive fibers show the strain-sensing behavior with a broad range of applied tensile strain. The AgNW reinforced highly stretchable conductive fibers can be embedded into a smart glove for detecting sign language by integrating five composite fibers in the glove, which can successfully perceive human motions.									457	24	0	0	30	0	468			1616-301X	1616-3028											2015-06-03	WOS:000355635300001

Fabricating hybrid-types of electrode materials and designing smart nanoarchitectures are effective approaches to developing high-performance SCs. Herein, first, a Ni-Co selenide material (Ni,Co)Se-2 with special cactus-like structure as the core, to scaffold the NiCo-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) shell, is designed and fabricated. The cactus-like structural (Ni,Co)Se-2 core, as a highly conductive and robust support, promotes the electron transport as well as hinders the agglomeration of LDHs. The synergistic contributions from the two types of active materials together with the superior properties of the cactus-like nanostructure enable the (Ni,Co)Se-2/NiCo-LDH hybrid electrode to exhibit a high capacity of approximate to 170 mA h g(-1) (approximate to 1224 F g(-1)), good rate performance, and long durability. The as-assembled (Ni,Co)Se-2/NiCo-LDH//PC (porous carbon) asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with an operating voltage of 1.65 V delivers a high energy density of 39 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 1650 W kg(-1). Therefore, the cactus-like core/shell structure offers an effective pathway to engineer advanced electrodes. The assembled flexible ASC is demonstrated to effectively power electronic devices.									194	10	0	0	12	0	195			1613-6810	1613-6829											2019-01-18	WOS:000456199000016	30556280

These semi-transparent LbL MXene-CNT composite films show high conductivities up to 130 S cm(-1) and high specific shielding effectiveness up to 58 187 dB cm(2) g(-1), which is attributed to both the excellent electrical conductivity of the conductive fillers (i.e., MXene and CNT) and the enhanced absorption with the LbL architecture of the films. Remarkably, these values are among the highest reported values for flexible and semi-transparent composite thin films. This work could offer new solutions for next-generation EMI shielding challenges.									341	32	0	0	21	0	347			1616-301X	1616-3028											2018-12-28	WOS:000450367700017

However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa(-1) for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa(-1) for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.									122	6	0	0	9	0	122			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-06-03	WOS:000665748900045	34080827

Signals from 23 participants were recorded along with the participants self-assessment of their affective state after each stimuli, in terms of valence, arousal, and dominance. All the signals were captured using portable, wearable, wireless, low-cost, and off-the-shelf equipment that has the potential to allow the use of affective computing methods in everyday applications. A baseline for participant-wise affect recognition using EEG and ECG-based features, as well as their fusion, was established through supervised classification experiments using support vector machines (SVMs). The selfassessment of the participants was evaluated through comparisonwith the self-assessments from another study using the same audio-visual stimuli. Classification results for valence, arousal, and dominance of the proposed database are comparable to the ones achieved for other databases that use nonportable, expensive, medical grade devices. These results indicate the prospects of using low-cost devices for affect recognition applications.

However, the high cost and low conductivity of high concentration LiTFSI greatly restrict the possibility of practical application. Herein, we adopt a new strategy to develop a low-cost and quasi-solid-state polyelectrolyte hydrogel accommodating a superhigh concentration of CH3COOK through in situ polymerization, avoiding the problem that many conventional polymers cannot accommodate ultra-high ion concentration. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel with 24 M CH3COOK exhibits a conductivity of up to 35.8 mS cm(-1) and a stretchability of 950%. With advanced N-doped graphene hydrogel electrodes, the assembled supercapacitor yields a voltage window of 2.1 V with an energy density of 33.0 W h kg(-1) and superior cyclability with 88.2% capacitance retention at 4 A g(-1) after 6000 cycles comparable to those supercapacitors using high-cost LiTFSI salts. Besides, the supercapacitor with excellent temperature stability in the range of -20 to 70 degrees C can light an LED for more than one minute. The assembled flexible device with the PAAK/CMC-24 M gel film sandwiched in between demonstrates excellent bendability from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and shows great potential for flexible/wearable electronic devices. Our feasible approach provides a new route for assembling quasi-solid-state flexible high-energy storage devices with "water-in-salt" electrolytes.									45	1	0	0	3	0	45			2040-3364	2040-3372											2021-03-14	WOS:000617768200027	33508053

In this review, we present recent advances (2016 to current) in the synthesis, structural and functional regulation, as well as healthcare applications of protein hydrogels. We provide detailed information on the synthesis of protein hydrogels via chemical, physical, and biological stim-ulations, and then introduce their unique self-healing, stimuli-responsive, swelling, mechanical, biological, and injectable properties. Furthermore, we analyze the strategies that can be utilized to regulate the structures and functions of protein hydrogels through tailoring the coiled-coil, porous, and periodic structure, as well as adding various functional materials into protein hydrogels. Finally, the healthcare applications of protein-based hydrogels for wearable devices, biosensors, drug/gene delivery, disease treatment, tissue engineering, cancer therapy, and bioimaging are demonstrated and discussed. It is the first effort to demonstrate excellent contri-butions of protein hydrogels to healthcare fields, which will be valuable for the readers to design and synthesize functional bio-hydrogels rationally and further to develop novel hydrogels for advanced applications.									11	0	0	0	7	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212											2022-08-23	WOS:000841013200002		
J	Yang, Bowen; Yuan, Weizhong								Highly Stretchable and Transparent Double-Network Hydrogel Ionic Conductors as Flexible Thermal-Mechanical Dual Sensors and Electroluminescent Devices								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				11	18			16765	16775				10.1021/acsami.9b01989							Article	MAY 8 2019	2019	The latest generation flexible devices feature materials that are conductive, highly stretchable, and transparent to meet the requirements of a reliable performance. However, the existing conductors are mostly electronic conductors, which cannot satisfy these high-performance challenges. A robust hydrogel ionic conductor was rapidly fabricated with a facile one-pot approach by employing bioinspired agar with a physically cross-linked network, polyacrylamide (PAM) with a photoinitiated cross-linked network under appropriate UV intensity, and Li+ as conductive ions. The resulting Li+/agar/PAM ionic double-network hydrogels could be fabricated into various shapes through injection. The unique ionic hydrogel showed a remarkable stretchability with over 1600% extension, high tension/compression strength (0.22 MPa/3.5 MPa), and toughness (2.2 MJ/m(3)). Furthermore, it was demonstrated to possess dual sensory capabilities through the combination of both temperature and mechanical deformation. This hydrogel ionic conductor exhibited high stretching sensitivity with a gauge factor of 1.8 at strain 1100% and bending sensitivity in a broad angle range of 30-150 degrees, respectively. Such highly optical transparency and elasticity endow the hydrogel-phosphor composites with promising luminescent properties. The multifunctional ionic hydrogel can be used as soft conductors for application in flexible devices such as ionic skin for wearable sensors and luminescence display.									198	9	0	0	27	0	201			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-06-04	WOS:000467781100054	30983316

Here, a low-cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high-fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal-to-noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 mu A kPa(-1). With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built-in algorithm is developed for one-click health data sharing and data-driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.									110	2	0	0	10	0	110			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-09-03	WOS:000691411700001	34467585

Stretchable electronic devices conventionally built with elastomeric thin films show a lack of permeability, which not only impedes wearing comfort and creates skin inflammation over long-term wearing but also limits the design form factors of device integration in the vertical direction. Here, we report a stretchable conductor that is fabricated by simply coating or printing liquid metal onto an electrospun elastomeric fibre mat. We call this stretchable conductor a liquid-metal fibre mat. Liquid metal hanging among the elastomeric fibres self-organizes into a laterally mesh-like and vertically buckled structure, which offers simultaneously high permeability, stretchability, conductivity and electrical stability. Furthermore, the liquid-metal fibre mat shows good biocompatibility and smart adaptiveness to omnidirectional stretching over 1,800% strain. We demonstrate the use of a liquid-metal fibre mat as a building block to realize highly permeable, multifunctional monolithic stretchable electronics.Coating of liquid metals on electrospun elastomeric fibre mats leads to the realization of conducting buckled meshes that can be stretched up to 1,800% strain while preserving both stable electrical properties and permeability to air and moisture.									242	21	0	0	23	0	245			1476-1122	1476-4660											2021-03-10	WOS:000619416100004	33603185

Organic ferroelectrics are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, low weight, environmentally friendly processing, and low processing temperatures. Although almost a century has passed since the first ferroelectric, Rochelle salt, was discovered, examples of highly desirable organic perovskite ferroelectrics are lacking. We found a family of metal-free organic perovskite ferroelectrics with the characteristic three-dimensional structure, among which MDABCO (N-methyl-N'-diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octonium)-ammonium triiodide has a spontaneous polarization of 22 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], a high phase transition temperature of 448 kelvins ( above that of BTO), and eight possible polarization directions. These attributes make it attractive for use in flexible devices, soft robotics, biomedical devices, and other applications.									454	26	0	0	28	0	462			0036-8075	1095-9203											2018-07-13	WOS:000438449200039	30002249

Development of such soft energy supply devices still remains a challenging task since conventional hydrogel electrolytes are quite vulnerable to mechanical deformation and exhibit low temperature-tolerance to maintain their functions under extremely cold conditions. Herein, a small molecule-based supramolecular-polymer double-network (SP-DN) hydrogel platform was developed by introducing a series of non-covalent self-assembled guanosine G-quadruplex supramolecular networks into covalently cross-linked polyacrylamide polymer networks. The obtained KOH (6 M)-filled SP-DN hydrogels exhibited excellent stretchability (>1600%) and wide temperature-tolerance (from -196 to 100 degrees C), superior interfacial adhesion to various electrode substrates, and ultra-high low- and high-temperature conductivities (252.2 mS cm(-1) at -50 degrees C; 431.7 mS cm(-1) at 100 degrees C). All these outstanding properties strongly recommend the application of SP-DN hydrogels as quasi-solid electrolytes for highly stretchable (device-level elongation >1000%) and wearable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). More interestingly, without any special pre-treatment, the fabricated stretchable ZABs are highly waterproof and temperature-resistant (down to -50 degrees C and up to 100 degrees C) with a high energy/power density and a stable long-cycle life. This study offers a new option to design water-based hydrogel electrolytes for highly stretchable and environment-adaptable energy storage devices.									60	3	0	0	5	0	62			1754-5692	1754-5706											2021-07-05	WOS:000665921800001

The currently available synthesis processes for high-efficiency bifunctional bimetallic sulfide electrodes typically require high-temperature hydrothermal or chemical vapor deposition, which is undesirable in terms of the complexity in experimental procedure and the damage of flexibility in the resultant electrode. Herein, a scalable fabrication process is reported by combining electrospinning with in situ sulfurization at room temperature to successfully obtain CuCo2S4 nanosheets@N-doped carbon nanofiber (CuCo2S4 NSs@N-CNFs) films, which show remarkable bifunctional catalytic performance (E-j (= 10) (OER) - E-1/2 (ORR) = 0.751 V) with excellent mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, the CuCo2S4 NSs@N-CNFs cathode delivers a high open-circuit potential of 1.46 V, an outstanding specific capacity of 896 mA h g(-1), when assembled into a quasi-solid-state flexible ZAB together with Zn NSs@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film (electrodeposited Zn nanosheets on CNTs film) as the anode. The ZAB also shows a good flexibility and capacity stability with 93.62% capacity retention (bending 1000 cycles from 0 degrees to 180 degrees), making it an excellent power source for portable and wearable electronic devices.									106	8	0	0	2	0	107				2198-3844											2019-07-17	WOS:000474217900001	31508279

Nevertheless, the dendrite formation issue and consecutive side reactions severely impede the practical applications of Zn metal at high current densities. Herein, it is reported that engineering the gel electrolyte with multifunctional charged groups by incorporating a zwitterionic gel poly(3-(1-vinyl-3-imidazolio) propanesulfonate) (PVIPS) can effectively address the abovementioned issues. The charged groups of sulfonate and imidazole in the gel electrolyte can texture the Zn2+ nucleation and deposition plane to (002), which possesses a high activation energy to resist side reactions and induce uniform growth of Zn metal for a dendrite-free structure. In addition, the Zn2+ solvation structure can be manipulated by the charged groups to further eliminate side reactions for high rate performance Zn batteries. Consequently, the polyzwitterionic gel electrolyte enables a stable cycling with a cumulative capacity of 3000 mA h cm(-2) at high density of 7.5 mA cm(-2) for the symmetrical Zn battery, and a long-term cycling life for more than 1000 cycles at 5 C of Zn/MnO2 full battery. It is envisioned that the design of the gel electrolyte will provide promising feasibility on safe, flexible, and wearable energy storage devices.									47	2	0	0	1	0	47				2198-3844											2022-01-30	WOS:000743888300001	35043600

Although the superhydrophobic barrier on the sensor surface has been extensively explored as a passive water repel strategy, the dense superhydrophobic surface often has limited flexibility and inevitably degradates in high humidity or saturated water vapor environments due to the nucleation and growth of small size water molecules. This work reports a superhydrophobic MXene-sodium alginate sponge (SMSS) pressure sensor with efficient low-voltage Joule heating to provide sustained superhydrophobicity for moisture-resistant sensing. The superhydrophobic surface on the outside can repel large size water droplets, whereas the Joule heating efficiently removes small size water droplets and significantly reduces water molecule adsorption throughout the sponge. Because of the sustained superhydrophobic barrier and high porosity in the sponge, the SMSS pressure sensor with high sensitivity, large sensing range, and quick response can accurately and reliably function and monitor varying biophysical signals even in extreme use scenarios with high humidity or water vapor environments.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212											2022-05-14	WOS:000791148600002	35110969

Over the past decades, a variety of inkjet-printed applications including thin-film transistors (TFTs), radio-frequency identification devices, sensors, and displays have been explored. In particular, many research groups have made great efforts to realize high-performance TFTs, for application as potential driving components of ubiquitous wearable electronics. Although there are still challenges to enable the commercialization of printed TFTs beyond laboratory-scale applications, the field of printed TFTs still attracts significant attention, with remarkable developments in soluble materials and printing methodology. Here, recent progress in printing-based TFTs is presented from materials to applications. Significant efforts to improve the electrical performance and device-yield of printed TFTs to match those of counterparts fabricated using conventional deposition or photolithography methods are highlighted. Moreover, emerging low-dimension printable semiconductors, including carbon nanotubes and transition metal dichalcogenides as well as mature semiconductors, and new-concept printed switching devices, are also discussed.									156	7	0	0	3	0	158				2198-3844											2019-04-10	WOS:000462613100010	30937255

Here, a new-typed TENG-JNM based on a flexible two-dimensional (2D) Janus nanofiber membrane (JNM) and PMMA nanobelt array is assembled, where JNM and PMMA nanobelt array are respectively constructed by special electmspun one-dimensional (1D) [CNTs/PVDF/PVP]//[Eu(TTA)(3)(TPPO)(2)/PVDF/PVP] Janus nanofiber and PMMA nanobelt as building units. Different functional substances are pre-assembled into Janus nanofiber utilizing structural asymmetry, so charge generation and charge capturing abilities are prerealized in microscopic 1D Janus nanofiber, which further makes 2D JNM concurrently act as charge generation and charge capturing layers of TENG-JNM without introducing usually-adopted additional macroscopic charge capturing layer. Two independent domains are gained in Janus nanofiber and different functional substances are limited in their own domains, effectively weakening harmful mutual interferences. JNM displays improved charge generation ability by introducing CNTs and Eu(TTA)(3)(TPPO)(2) and high charge capturing ability by utilizing the two-phase interfaces between Eu(TTA)(3)(TPPO)(2) and PVDF matrix to timely capture triboelectric charges to avoid adverse combination with induced charges and charge dissipation. PMMA nanobelt array with compact and smooth surface is also conducive to acquiring adequate contact area between PMMA nanobelt array and JNM. TENG-JNM gains high and adjustable output performance, in which the maximum output performance is 22.4 mu A, 353.5 V and 135.5 mu C.m(-2). TENG-JNM is endowed with excellent red fluorescence, realizing the visualization of working state in dark environment. TENG-JNM has potential application values in electronic skin or wearable devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212											2022-10-19	WOS:000864664200003

However, the invalid 2D architecture of fabric limits the application in thermoelectrics. Here, we make the valid thermoelectric fabric woven out of thermoelectric fibers producing an unobtrusive working thermoelectric module. Alternately doped carbon nanotube fibers wrapped with acrylic fibers are woven into p-type thermoelectric modules. Utilizing elasticity originating from interlocked thermoelectric modules, stretchable 3D thermoelectric generators without substrate can be made to enable sufficient alignment with the heat flow direction. The textile generator shows a peak power density of 70mWm(-2) for a temperature difference of 44 K and excellent stretchability (similar to 80% strain) with no output degradation. The compatibility between body movement and sustained power supply is further displayed. The generators described here are true textiles, proving active thermoelectrics can be woven into various fabric architectures for sensing, energy harvesting, or thermal management.									147	7	0	0	7	0	148			2041-1723												2020-09-10	WOS:000563511900005	31996675

However, many great challenges remain to be overcome, notably the design and fabrication of flexible electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance and matching them with safe and reliable electrolytes. Herein, a facile approach for preparing flexible electrodes, which employs carbon cloth derived from commercial cotton cloth as the substrate of cathode and a flexible anode, is proposed and investigated. The promising cathode (NVPOF@FCC) with high conductivity and outstanding flexibility is prepared by efficiently coating Na3V2(PO4)(2)O2F (NVPOF) on flexible carbon cloth (FCC), which exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance and the significantly improved reaction kinetics. More importantly, a novel flexible quasi-solid-state sodium-ion full battery (QSFB) is feasibly assembled by sandwiching a P(VDF-HFP)-NaClO4 gel-polymer electrolyte film between the advanced NVPOF@FCC cathode and FCC anode. And the QSFBs are further evaluated in flexible pouch cells, which not only demonstrates excellent energy-storage performance in aspect of great cycling stability and high-rate capability, but also impressive flexibility and safety. This work offers a feasible and effective strategy for the design of flexible electrodes, paving the way for the progression of practical and sustainable flexible batteries.									61	2	0	0	0	0	61			1998-0124	1998-0000											2021-07-07	WOS:000666904000002

When data is obtained from multiple devices, multi-sensor fusion is desirable to transform potentially erroneous sensor data into high quality fused data. In this work, a data fusion enabled Ensemble approach is proposed to work with medical data obtained from BSNs in a fog computing environment. Daily activity data is obtained from a collection of sensors which is fused together to generate high quality activity data. The fused data is later input to an Ensemble classifier for early heart disease prediction. The ensembles are hosted in a Fog computing environment and the prediction computations are performed in a decentralised manners. The results from the individual nodes in the fog computing environment are then combined to produce a unified output. For the classification purpose, a novel kernel random forest ensemble is used that produces significantly better quality results than random forest. An extensive experimental study supports the applicability of the solution and the obtained results are promising, as we obtain 98% accuracy when the tree depth is equal to 15, number of estimators is 40, and 8 features are considered for the prediction task.									150	5	0	0	8	1	155			1566-2535	1872-6305											2019-10-21	WOS:000488995000015

As the key component for electronic devices, the design of a suitable semiconductor is essential, while the solution processability and structural tunability of polymer semiconductor make it a promising candidate. Along this line, it is important to consider the mechanical properties of polymer semiconductors in the design of flexible and stretchable devices placed on soft and curved surfaces to accommodate the constant movement of the human body. However, achieving high mechanical deformability and high charge transport properties simultaneously in polymer semiconductors remains a major challenge. In this trend article, we survey various approaches in designing intrinsically stretchable conjugated polymers, focusing on structure-property relationships from a molecular perspective, such as molecular weight, regioregularity, backbone and side chain modifications. Understanding the influence of these molecular structure parameters on thin film morphology may provide general guidelines for achieving desired microstructures that allow mechanical deformation without interrupting charge transport. Beyond highlighting recent key work in this field, we will discuss future prospects of stretchable conjugated polymers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The generator, consisting of a force amplifier, a piezoelectric stack, a spring-mass system, and a spring limiter, realizes ultra-low frequency conversion mainly through the impact-induced frequency conversion effect. To estimate the output voltage of the generator numerically, we built a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) equivalent model based on the mechanical structure of the harvester. Moreover, we conducted five series of experiments to investigate the output performance of a fabricated prototype. The prototype generates an instantaneous peak-peak output power of 5.56 W (averaged power of 0.93 mW) excited by human running motions. A 'SHU' LED array was lighted up in real-time suc-cessfully. We then tested the performance of the prototype in a real-time self-powered system. The generator is able to power a watch and a thermometer in real-time. More importantly, when the excitation stops, they are powered by redundant charges for approximately 50 minutes and 1 minute, respectively. This research can make an essential contribution to ultra-low frequency vibration energy harvesting and the realization of real-time self-powered wearable devices.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0196-8904	1879-2227											2022-04-27	WOS:000784292500001

The elastomer is used both as the matrix for the conductor and as the triboelectric layer. The nanogenerator showed a stretchability of 2500% and it recovered its energy-harvesting performance after extreme mechanical damage, due to the supramolecular hydrogen bonding of the thermoplastic elastomer.

Previously reported robotic sensing technologies have primarily focused on monitoring physical parameters such as pressure and temperature. Integrating chemical sensors for autonomous dry-phase analyte detection on a robotic platform is rather extremely challenging and substantially underdeveloped. Here, we introduce an artificial intelligence-powered multimodal robotic sensing system (M-Bot) with an all-printed mass-producible soft electronic skin-based human-machine interface. A scalable inkjet printing technology with custom-developed nanomaterial inks was used to manufacture flexible physicochemical sensor arrays for electrophysiology recording, tactile perception, and robotic sensing of a wide range of hazardous materials including nitroaromatic explosives, pesticides, nerve agents, and infectious pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The M-Bot decodes the surface electromyography signals collected from the human body through machine learning algorithms for remote robotic control and can perform in situ threat compound detection in extreme or contaminated environments with user-interactive tactile and threat alarm feedback. The printed electronic skin-based robotic sensing technology can be further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms.

However, their practical applications are severely hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air cathode. Herein, a porphyrin covalent organic framework (POF) was innovatively designed and applied as a cathode electrocatalyst for flexible Zn-air batteries. Porphyrin active sites were periodically constructed into well-defined two-dimensional (2D) frameworks precisely controlled at the atomic level, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) served as scaffolds for further morphology regulation. Interwoven into a free-standing, robust, and flexible film, the as-fabricated CNT@POF hybrid demonstrates impressive performance in rechargeable liquid and flexible all-solid-state Zn-air batteries. Specifically, the liquid Zn-air battery with the CNT@POF cathode exhibits a small voltage gap of 0.71 V and outstanding stability for 200 cycles, even better than the noble-metal-based cathode. Flexible all-solid-state Zn-air batteries demonstrate a high energy efficiency of 61.6% at 1.0 mA cm(-2) and the flexibility to stably light a red light-emitting diode (LED, 2.0 V) when bent to different degrees. This contribution demonstrates versatile and ingenious strategies for the multiscale regulation of advanced materials for energy electrocatalysis and thereby facilitates their applications in flexible and safe energy storage and conversion.									244	28	0	0	11	0	249			1754-5692	1754-5706											2018-07-01	WOS:000438392400006

Herein, a directional freeze-casting and annealing approach is reported for the construction of a 3D honeycomb nanostructured, N,P-doped carbon aerogel incorporating in situ grown FeP/Fe(2)O(3)nanoparticles as the cathode in a flexible Zn-air battery (ZAB). The aqueous rechargeable Zn-air batteries assembled with this carbon aerogel exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 648 mAh g(-1)at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2)with a good long-term durability, outperforming those assembled with commercial Pt/C+RuO(2)catalyst. Furthermore, such a foldable carbon aerogel with directional channels can serve as a freestanding air cathode for flexible solid-state Zn-air batteries without the use of carbon paper/cloth and additives, giving a specific capacity of 676 mAh g(-1)and an energy density of 517 Wh kg(-1)at 5 mA cm(-2)together with good cycling stability.

These applications are being developed in a variety of domains, but rigorous research is needed to examine the potential, as well as the challenges, of utilizing mobile technologies to improve health outcomes. Currently, evidence is sparse for the efficacy of mHealth. Although these technologies may be appealing and seemingly innocuous, research is needed to assess when, where, and for whom mHealth devices, apps, and systems are efficacious.In order to outline an approach to evidence generation in the field of mHealth that would ensure research is conducted on a rigorous empirical and theoretic foundation, on August 16, 2011, researchers gathered for the mHealth Evidence Workshop at NIH. The current paper presents the results of the workshop. Although the discussions at the meeting were cross-cutting, the areas covered can be categorized broadly into three areas: (1) evaluating assessments; (2) evaluating interventions; and (3) reshaping evidence generation using mHealth. This paper brings these concepts together to describe current evaluation standards, discuss future possibilities, and set a grand goal for the emerging field of mHealth research.

Socks with sensing capabilities can reveal more direct sensory information on the body for longer duration in daily life. However, the limitation of suitable materials for smart textile makes the development of multifunctional socks a major challenge. In this paper, we have developed a self-powered and self-functional sock (S-2-sock) to realize diversified functions including energy harvesting and sensing various physiological signals, i.e., gait, contact force, sweat level, etc., by hybrid integrating poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-coated fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric chips. An output power of 1.71 mW is collected from a PEDOT:PSS-coated sock with mild jumping at 2 Hz and load resistance of 59.7 M Omega The study shows that cotton socks worn daily can potentially be a power source for enabling self-sustained socks comprising wireless transmission modules and integrated circuits in the future. We also investigate the influences of environmental humidity, temperature, and weight variations and verify that our S-2-sock can successfully achieve walking pattern recognition and motion tracking for smart home applications. On the basis of the sensor fusion concept, the outputs from TENG and PZT sensors under exercise activities are effectively merged together for quick detection of the sweat level. By leveraging the hybrid S-2-sock, we can achieve more functionality in the applications of foot-based energy harvesting and monitoring the diversified physiological signals for healthcare, smart homes, etc.									281	12	0	0	8	0	284			1936-0851	1936-086X											2019-02-01	WOS:000460199400093	30741521

However, the electrical conductivities of hydrogels are often lower than 1 S cm(-1 )which are not suitable for digital circuits or applications in bioelec txonics. Introducing conductive inorganic fillers into the hydrogels can improve their electrical conductivities. However, it may lead to compromises in compliance, biocompatibility, deformability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, a series of highly conductive ionic liquid (IL) doped PEDOT:PSS hydrogels without any conductive fillers is reported. These hydrogels exhibit high conductivities up to approximate to 305 S cm(-1), which is approximate to 8 times higher than the record of polymeric hydrogels without conductive fillers in literature. The high electrical conductivity results in enhanced areal thermoelectric output power for hydrogel-based thermoelectric devices, and high specific electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency which is about an order in magnitude higher than that of state-of-the-art conductive hydrogels in literature. Furthermore, these stretchable (strain >30%) hydrogels exhibit fast self-healing, and shape/size-tunable properties, which are desirable for hydrogel bioelectronics and wearable organic devices. The results indicate that these highly conductive hydrogels are promising in applications such as sensing, thermoelectrics, EMI shielding, etc.									35	3	0	0	4	0	35			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-02-28	WOS:000753766000001	35064696

While researchers are exploiting a plethora of techniques to create life-like three-dimensional (3D) objects, there is a lack of awareness of the role of human perception in guiding the hardware development. An ultimate VR/AR headset must inte grate the display, sensors, and processors in a compact enclosure that people can comfortably wear for a long time while allowing a superior immersion experience and user-friendly human-computer interaction. Compared with other 3D displays, the holographic display has unique advantages in providing natural depth cues and correcting eye aberrations. Therefore, it holds great promise to be the enabling technology for next-generation VR/AR devices.

Although organohydrogels can improve the environmental stability of materials, their development is at the expense of reducing electrical conductivity and thus weakening EM interference shielding ability. Here, a MXene organohydrogel is prepared which is composed of MXene network for electron conduction, binary solvent channels for ion conduction, and abundant solvent-polymer-MXene interfaces for EM wave scattering. This organohydrogel possesses excellent anti-drying ability, low-temperature tolerance, stretchability, shape adaptability, adhesion and rapid self-healing ability. Two effective strategies have been proposed to solve the problems of current organohydrogel shielding materials. By reasonably controlling the MXene content and the glycerol-water ratio in the gel, MXene organohydrogel can exhibit exceptionally enhanced EM interference shielding performances compared to MXene hydrogel due to the increased physical cross-linking density of the gel. Moreover, MXene organohydrogel shows attractive stretching-enhanced interference effectiveness, caused by the connection and parallel arrangement of MXene nanosheets. This well-designed MXene organohydrogel has potential applications in shielding EM interference in deformable and wearable electronic devices.									33	7	0	0	3	0	33			2311-6706	2150-5551											2022-03-31	WOS:000771472800002	35312862

Because of their unique functionalities, the OSC field is expected to enable innovative photovoltaic applications that can be difficult to achieve using traditional inorganic solar cells: OSCs are printable, portable, wearable, disposable, biocompatible, and attachable to curved surfaces. The ultimate objective of this field is to develop cost-effective, stable, and high-performance photovoltaic modules fabricated on large-area flexible plastic substrates via high-volume/throughput roll-to-roll printing processing and thus achieve the practical implementation of OSCs. Recently, intensive research efforts into the development of organic materials, processing techniques, interface engineering, and device architectures have led to a remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiencies, exceeding 11%, which has finally brought OSCs close to commercialization. Current research interests are expanding from academic to industrial viewpoints to improve device stability and compatibility with large-scale printing processes, which must be addressed to realize viable applications. Here, both academic and industrial issues are reviewed by highlighting historically monumental research results and recent state-of-the-art progress in OSCs.

Although current image sensors can perceive simple images in real time, the image information fades away when the external image stimuli are removed. The deficiency between the state-of-the-art image sensors and visual memory system inspires the logical integration of image sensors and memory devices to realize the sensing and memory process toward light information for the bionic design of human visual memory. Hence, a facile architecture is designed to construct artificial flexible visual memory system by employing an UV-motivated memristor. The visual memory arrays can realize the detection and memory process of UV light distribution with a patterned image for a long-term retention and the stored image information can be reset by a negative voltage sweep and reprogrammed to the same or an other image distribution, which proves the effective reusability. These results provide new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory and enable the flexible visual memory device to be applied in future wearable electronics, electronic eyes, multifunctional robotics, and auxiliary equipment for visual handicapped.									244	23	0	0	12	0	249			0935-9648	1521-4095											2018-02-15	WOS:000424891900024	29315837

Here, we first synthesized the rGO-LiOH/wood micro-spring composite with high strength, high specific capacitance, high elasticity and elastic recovery rate via vacuum suction and carbonization. The as-obtained wood-based hybrid is applied to super-capacitors and sensors, and shows good supercapacitance and sensing characteristics. Under a scan rate of 200 mV s(-1), the specific capacitance is 352 F g(-1), the energy density is 48.89 Wh kg-1, the power density reaches 9780 W kg(-1), and the capacitance retention still maintains at 98% (346 F g(-1)) after experiencing 1000 cycles, showing excellent energy storage and working stability. More importantly, the composite still shows stable energy storage effect under repeated compression rebound conditions. After 5000 compression-recovery, a high elastic recovery rate of 91.67% and high capacitance retention of approximately 80% are still obtained. These outstanding properties highlight the great application potential of the rGO-LiOH/wood micro-spring composite in biomass based wearable electronics, portable power supply equipment and sensors.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0926-6690	1872-633X											2022-04-20	WOS:000775693300004

Among the existing flexible organic solar cells, ultrathin organic solar cells with a total thickness <10 mu m have important advantages, including good mechanical bending stabilities and good conformability. These advantages have led to power generation solutions for wearable electronics. In this essay, the progress of flexible and ultrathin organic solar cells, and the future research directions pertaining to these cells are discussed based on the potential applications of textile-compatible solar cells. Both process engineering and development of the material of ultrathin substrate films have improved the PCE of ultrathin organic solar cells, which in turn have led to the small PCE difference between flexible organic solar cells with substrate thickness >10 mu m and ultrathin organic solar cells with substrate thickness <= 10 mu m. Key technologies for the further improvement of PCE of flexible/ultrathin organic solar cells are discussed. Strategies to improve the stability and some important aspects, which determine the mechanical robustness of flexible organic solar cells, are also presented and discussed.									241	21	0	0	7	0	245			1614-6832	1614-6840											2020-05-15	WOS:000530560200001

When addressing the needs associated with the human body, such as the detection of mechanical functions, monitoring of health parameters, and integration with human tissues, optoelectronic devices, interconnects/circuits enabling their functions, and the core passive components from which the whole system is built must sustain different degrees of mechanical stresses. Herein, the basic characteristics and performance of several of these devices are reported, particularly focusing on the conducting element constituting them. Among these devices, strain sensors of different types, energy storage elements, and power/energy storage and generators are included. Specifically, the advances during the past 3 years are reported, wherein mechanically flexible conducting elements are fabricated from (0D, 1D, and 2D) conducting nanomaterials from metals (e.g., Au nanoparticles, Ag flakes, Cu nanowires), carbon nanotubes/nanofibers, 2D conductors (e.g., graphene, MoS2), metal oxides (e.g., Zn nanorods), and conducting polymers (e.g., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrene sulfonate), polyaniline) in combination with passive fibrotic and elastomeric materials enabling, after integration, the so-called electronic skins and electronic textiles.									263	8	0	0	26	0	265			0935-9648	1521-4095											2019-07-01	WOS:000477972300007	31106490

Herein, after a brief introduction to supercapacitors and multivalent metal ion batteries, we reviewed the recent progress in research on multivalent metal ion hybrid capacitors, with a focus on zinc-ion hybrid capacitors, from the perspectives of design concept, configuration, electrochemical behavior and energy storage mechanism. An outlook of the future research regarding multivalent metal ion hybrid capacitors was also presented.

Here we report a novel energy storage system of zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSs), in which activated carbon materials, Zn metal and ZnSO4 aqueous solution serve as cathode, anode and electrolyte, respectively. Reversible ion adsorption/desorption on AC cathode and Zn2+ deposition/stripping on Zn anode enable the ZHSs to repeatedly and rapidly store/deliver electrical energy, accompanying with a capacity of 121 mAh g(-1) (corresponding to an energy of 84 Wh kg(-1)), a very large power output of 14.9 kW kg(-1) and an excellent cycling stability with 91% capacity retention over 10000 cycles. The extremely safe, high-rate and ultralong-life ZHSs are believed to provide new options for next-generation energy storage devices.									440	35	0	0	16	0	443			2405-8297												2018-12-28	WOS:000436924800011

However, the easy freezing and drying of water-based hydrogels significantly limit their long-term stability. Here, a facile solvent-replacement strategy is developed to fabricate ethylene glycol (Eg)/glycerol (Gl)-water binary antifreezing and antidrying organohydrogels for ultrastretchable and sensitive strain sensing within a wide temperature range. Because of the ready formation of strong hydrogen bonds between Eg/Gl and water molecules, the organohydrogels gain exceptional freezing and drying tolerance with retained deformability, conductivity, and self-healing ability even stay at extreme temperature for a long time. Thus, the fabricated strain sensor displays a gauge factor of 6, which is much higher than previously reported values for hydrogel-based strain sensors. Furthermore, the strain sensor exhibits a relatively wide strain range (0.5-950%) even at -18 degrees C. Various human motions with different strain levels are monitored by the strain sensor with good stability and repeatability from -18 to 25 degrees C. The organohydrogels maintained the strain sensing capability when exposed to ambient air for nine months. This work provides new insight into the fabrication of stable, ultrastretchable, and ultrasensitive strain sensors using chemically modified organohydrogel for emerging wearable electronics.									242	10	0	0	23	0	241			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-03-06	WOS:000460996900077	30763515

Unimpeded by geographical boundaries, smartphone-linked wearable sensors, point-of-need diagnostic devices, and medical-grade imaging, all built around real-time data streams and supported by automated clinical decision-support tools, will enable care and enhance our understanding of physiological variability. However, the path to mHealth incorporation into clinical care is fraught with challenges. We currently lack high-quality evidence that supports the adoption of many new technologies and have financial, regulatory, and security hurdles to overcome. Fortunately, sweeping efforts are under way to establish the true capabilities and value of the evolving mHealth field.									377	4	2	0	81	2	383			1946-6234	1946-6242											2015-04-15	WOS:000353377000010	25877894

However, due to the sparsity problem, traditional recommendation algorithms are difficult to achieve desired performance. Considering that consumers often buy and rate other types of items on E-commerce platforms, we can leverage significant information in the auxiliary domains to improve the recommendation performance of healthcare wearables, which can be regarded as cross-domain recommendation. However, traditional cross-domain recommendation model cannot fully represent user's characteristics and fail to consider the leaks of original auxiliary domain ratings during the information transfer process. To overcome the two shortcomings, this paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Cross-Domain Healthcare Wearables Recommendation algorithm (PPCDHWRec). Firstly, user's characteristics are divided into domain-dependent features and domain-independent features, which complement each other and fully depict the user's characteristics. Secondly, inspired by the latent factor model, we factorize the original rating information of each auxiliary domain by Funk-SVD and Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization (ONMTF) model, to obtain user's domain-dependent and domain-independent features, respectively. Finally, the Factorization Machine algorithm is used to fuse the obtained user's features with the target domain information to provide the recommendation results. By hiding the item latent factors obtained in the factorization process, PPCDHWRec ensures that the original information cannot be inferred from the transferred user hidden vector. Hence, PPCDHWRec is a privacy-preserving recommendation model. Experiments on two groups of auxiliary domains, having high and low correlations with target domain, show the effectiveness of PPCDHWRec.									46	1	0	0	1	0	47			2168-2194	2168-2208											2023-03-29	WOS:000803118600007	33793406

This has triggered increasing attention on the development of robust machine learning techniques that exploits multimodal sensor setups. However, unlike other applications, there are no established benchmarking problems for this field. As a matter of fact, methods are usually tested on custom datasets acquired in very specific experimental setups. Furthermore, data is seldom shared between different groups. Our goal is to address this issue by introducing a versatile human activity dataset recorded in a sensor-rich environment. This database was the basis of an open challenge on activity recognition. We report here the outcome of this challenge, as well as baseline performance using different classification techniques. We expect this benchmarking database will motivate other researchers to replicate and outperform the presented results, thus contributing to further advances in the state-of-the-art of activity recognition methods.

Textiles coated with these materials exhibit a broad range of functionalities, including spontaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon absorption of daylight, and long-term ROS storage in dark conditions. The ROS generation and storage abilities of these materials can be further improved through chemical engineering of the precursors without altering the three-dimensional assembled superstructures. In comparison with traditional TiO2 or C3N4 self-cleaning materials, the fluorinated molecular coating material HOF-101-F shows a 10- to 60-fold enhancement of ROS generation and 10- to 20-fold greater ROS storage ability. Our results pave the way for further developing self-cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light-free conditions.									34	2	0	0	2	0	33			1433-7851	1521-3773											2022-01-08	WOS:000737297900001	34931436

However, the restrained surface area of fibers and limited reaction kinetics of active materials are unfavorable for performance enhancement. Herein, an efficient multicomponent hierarchical structure is constructed by integrating the Cu-doped cobalt copper carbonate hydroxide@nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide (CCCH@NiCo-LDH) core-shell nanowire arrays (NWAs) on Cu fibers with highly conductive Au-modified CuO nanosheets (CCCH@NiCo-LDH NWAs@Au-CuO/Cu) via a novel in situ corrosion growth method. This multicomponent hierarchical structure contributes to a large accessible surface area, which results in sufficient permeation of the electrolyte. The Cu dopant could reduce the work function and facilitate fast charge transfer kinetics. Therefore, the effective ion diffusion and electron conduction will facilitate the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the electrode. Benefiting from this unique structure, the electrode delivers a high specific capacitance (1.97 F cm(-2)/1237 F g(-1)/193.3 mAh g(-1)) and cycling stability (90.8% after 30 000 cycles), exhibiting superb performance compared with most oxide-based fiber electrodes. Furthermore, the hybrid fiber supercapacitor of CCCH@NiCo-LDH NWAs@Au-CuO/Cu//VN/carbon fibers is fabricated, providing a remarkable maximal energy density of 34.97 Wh kg(-1) and a power density of 13.86 kW kg(-1), exhibiting a great potential in high-performance fiber-shape energy-related systems.									263	14	0	0	9	0	263			1616-301X	1616-3028											2019-06-01	WOS:000471074000008

The resulting dry supramolecular network simultaneous exhibits tough mechanical strength, high stretchability, self-healing ability, and processability at room temperature. The excellent performance of these distinct supramolecular polymers is attributed to the hierarchical existence of four types of dynamic combinations in the high-density dry network, including dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, noncovalent H-bonds, iron-carboxylate complexes and ionic clustering interactions. The extremely facile preparation method of this self-healing polymer offers prospects for high-performance low-cost material among others for coatings and wearable devices.									146	5	0	0	14	0	147			1433-7851	1521-3773											2020-03-09	WOS:000515397000001	32096593

The as-prepared Cu NPs-LIG sensor demonstrates an excellent glucose sensitivity of 495 mu M mM(-1) cm(-2), ultrafast response time less than 0.5 s and the prominently low detection limit of 0.39 mu M. Besides, the sensor shows extraordinary reproducibility, stability and selectivity in glucose sensing. Finally, a possible mechanism of the Cu NPs-LIG sensor for glucose sensing is proposed. Due to the simplicity preparation and performance reliability, the novel flexible Cu NPs-LIG sensor is an attractive candidate for next generation wearable and implantable non-enzymatic glucose diagnostic devices.

Widely used polyvinyl alcohol-based electrolytes are neither very stretchable nor compressible, which fundamentally limits the realization of supercapacitors with high stretchability and compressibility. A new electrolyte that is intrinsically super-stretchable and compressible is presented. Vinyl hybrid silica nanoparticle cross-linkers were introduced into polyacrylamide hydrogel backbones to promote dynamic cross-linking of the polymer networks. These cross-linkers serve as stress buffers to dissipate energy when strain is applied, providing a solution to the intrinsically low stretchability and compressibility shortcomings of conventional supercapacitors. The newly developed supercapacitor and electrolyte can be stretched up to an unprecedented 1000% strain with enhanced performance, and compressed to 50% strain with good retention of the initial performance.									395	28	0	0	32	0	404			1433-7851	1521-3773											2017-07-24	WOS:000424260200037	28631401

It is due to not only their tunable optical, electrochemical, and structural properties, but also many superior features that are not readily available in conventional polymer fullerene solar cells (fullerene-PSCs) including long-term stability, synthetic accessibility, and excellent film-forming properties suitable for large-scale manufacturing. Recent breakthroughs in material design and device engineering have driven the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs exceeding 11%, which is comparable to the performance of fullerene-PSCs. Furthermore, outstanding mechanical durability and stretchability have been reported for all-PSCs, which make them stand out from the other small molecule-based PSCs as a promising power supplier for wearable electronic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the important work in allPSCs, in which pertinent examples are deliberately chosen. First, we describe the key components that enabled the recent progresses of all-PSCs including rational design rules for efficient PDs and P(A)s, blend morphology control, and light harvesting engineering. We also review the recent work on the understanding of the stability of all-PSCs under various external conditions, which highlights the importance of all-PSCs for future implementation and commercialization. Finally, because all-PSCs have not yet achieved their full potential and are still undergoing rapid development, we offer our views on the current challenges and future prospects.									458	39	0	0	8	0	463			0009-2665	1520-6890											2019-08-02	WOS:000475532500007	31181904

However, the practical application of metamaterials is found challenging due to the high losses, strong dispersion associated with the resonant responses, and the difficulty in the fabrication of nanoscale 3D structures. The optical metasurface is termed as 2D metamaterials that inherent all of the properties of metamaterials and also provide a solution to the limitation of the conventional metamaterials. Over the past few years, metasurfaces; have been employed for the design and fabrication of optical elements and systems with abilities that surpass the performance of conventional diffractive optical elements. Metasurfaces can be fabricated using standard lithography and nanoimprinting methods, which is easier campared to the fabrication of the counterpart 3 days metamaterials. In this review article, the progress of the research on metasurfaces is illustrated. Concepts of anomalous reflection and refraction, applications of metasurfaces with the Pancharatanm-Berry Phase, and Huygens metasurface are discussed. The development of soft metasurface opens up a new dimension of application zone in conformal or wearable photonics. The progress of soft metasurface has also been discussed in this review. Meta-devices that are being developed with the principle of the shaping of wavefronts are elucidated in this review. Furthermore, it has been established that properties of novel optical metasurface can be modulated by the change in mechanical, electrical, or optical stimuli which leads to the development of dynamic metasurface. Research thrusts over the area of tunable metasurface has been reviewed in this article. Over the recent year, it has been found that optical fibers and metasurface are coagulated for the development of optical devices with the advantages of both domains. The metasurface with lab-on fiber-based devices is being discussed in this review paper.

The possibility to revolutionize our daily life with such disruptive appliances has fueled the quest for electronic devices which yield good electrical and mechanical performance and are at the same time light-weight, transparent, conformable, stretchable, and even biodegradable. Flexible metal oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) can fulfill all these requirements and are therefore considered the most promising technology for tomorrow's electronics. This review reflects the establishment of flexible metal oxide semiconductor TFTs, from the development of single devices, large-area circuits, up to entirely integrated systems. First, an introduction on metal oxide semiconductor TFTs is given, where the history of the field is revisited, the TFT configurations and operating principles are presented, and the main issues and technological challenges faced in the area are analyzed. Then, the recent advances achieved for flexible n-type metal oxide semiconductor TFTs manufactured by physical vapor deposition methods and solution-processing techniques are summarized. In particular, the ability of flexible metal oxide semiconductor TFTs to combine low temperature fabrication, high carrier mobility, large frequency operation, extreme mechanical bendability, together with transparency, conformability, stretchability, and water dissolubility is shown. Afterward, a detailed analysis of the most promising metal oxide semiconducting materials developed to realize the state-of-the-art flexible p-type TFTs is given. Next, the recent progresses obtained for flexible metal oxide semiconductor-based electronic circuits, realized with both unipolar and complementary technology, are reported. In particular, the realization of large-area digital circuitry like flexible near field communication tags and analog integrated circuits such as bendable operational amplifiers is presented. The last topic of this review is devoted for emerging flexible electronic systems, from foldable displays, power transmission elements to integrated systems for large-area sensing and data storage and transmission. Finally, the conclusions are drawn and an outlook over the field with a prediction for the future is provided.

Perovskite quantum dots have been recently emerging as a potentially relevant material because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties; however, some issues regarding instability and environmental impact remains as stumbling blocks. This research presents a promising and facile method for incorporating lead toxicity reduced inorganic perovskite quantum dots (IPQDs; CsPb0.25Zn0.75I3) with eco-friendly cellulose nano crystal (CNC) ligands into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) electrospun nanofibers (PPNG) forming potential piezoelectric and pyroelectric applications. Applying distinct pressures through finger tapping, air pressure, hand bending, fist beating, and foot striking generates intriguing self-powered energy harvesting sensory performances. PPNG produces stable and sensitive signals with highest open-circuit voltage of 20.3 V, short circuit current of 1.2 mu A cm(-2), and power density of 29.0 mu W cm(-3). Furthermore, the material was found to be successful in pyrocatalytic decay of Rhodamine-B dye; the maximum dye decay was 91% and it exhibits five reusable cycles with ultra-low lead leakages (< 1 ppm) because of the photo thermal property of the IPQDs, and excellent stability offered by dual encapsulation. The wearable and durable performances exhibited by the PPNGs can potentially bring limelight in the fabrication of scalable wearable optoelectronic device.									27	0	0	0	1	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212											2022-04-24	WOS:000777612900003

We considered original research published in English comparing Fitbit versus a reference-or research-standard criterion in healthy adults and those living with any health condition or disability. We assessed risk of bias using a modification of the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments. We explored measurement accuracy for steps, energy expenditure, sleep, time in activity, and distance using group percentage differences as the common rubric for error comparisons. We conducted descriptive analyses for frequency of accuracy comparisons within a +/- 3% error in controlled and +/- 10% error in free-living settings and assessed for potential bias of over-or underestimation. We secondarily explored how variations in body placement, ambulation speed, or type of activity influenced accuracy.Results: We included 67 studies. Consistent evidence indicated that Fitbit devices were likely to meet acceptable accuracy for step count approximately half the time, with a tendency to underestimate steps in controlled testing and overestimate steps in free-living settings. Findings also suggested a greater tendency to provide accurate measures for steps during normal or self-paced walking with torso placement, during jogging with wrist placement, and during slow or very slow walking with ankle placement in adults with no mobility limitations. Consistent evidence indicated that Fitbit devices were unlikely to provide accurate measures for energy expenditure in any testing condition. Evidence from a few studies also suggested that, compared with research-grade accelerometers, Fitbit devices may provide similar measures for time in bed and time sleeping, while likely markedly overestimating time spent in higher-intensity activities and underestimating distance during faster-paced ambulation. However, further accuracy studies are warranted. Our point estimations for mean or median percentage error gave equal weighting to all accuracy comparisons, possibly misrepresenting the true point estimate for measurement bias for some of the testing conditions we examined.Conclusions: Other than for measures of steps in adults with no limitations in mobility, discretion should be used when considering the use of Fitbit devices as an outcome measurement tool in research or to inform health care decisions, as there are seemingly a limited number of situations where the device is likely to provide accurate measurement.									208	0	0	0	42	1	210			2291-5222												2018-08-23	WOS:000441427700001	30093371

However, these systems usually require external power to convert changes in strain into electrical signals. Here, a self-powered strain sensor is developed based on a gelatin-based hydrogel and a galvanic cell. In the hydrogel matrix, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between tannic acid and gelatin give the prepared hydrogel great potential for elongation (1600%). The hydrogel also has a rapid self-healing ability (within 0.65 s) and high self-healing efficiency (95%). The hydrogel operates as an efficient electrolyte material and forms a hydrogel battery when assembled with a thin layer of zinc and an air electrode. This device had excellent tolerance to large compressional strain without sacrificing open-circuit voltage. On the basis of this hydrogel battery, we fabricated a self-powered strain sensor by connecting the hydrogel battery to a fixed resistor to form a closed loop. By converting its chemical energy into electrical energy, the self-powered sensor efficiently converted resistance changes, caused by stretching or compression of the hydrogel, into changes in the voltage output signals without external power. Owing to the stretchability of the hydrogel, the self-powered sensor exhibited good response and flexibility. Self-healing and continuous cycling tests confirmed the long-term stability of the device. These properties suggest that our self-powered sensor has a potential for applications to portable and wearable electronic devices.									127	7	0	0	26	0	130			1944-8244	1944-8252											2020-02-20	WOS:000507146100159	31808668

Continuous and long-term monitoring of the body is preferred since new diseases are always emerging in a sudden manner, including the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On the one hand, using wearable devices has been becoming a popular lifestyle to access the personal health status anywhere and anytime. On the other hand, with an increasing elderly population, finding practical health care solutions is becoming more challenging than ever. Compared with acute diseases that may be treated intensively in a relatively short amount of time, chronic diseases bring forth many clinical treatment requirements, including the need for long-term health condition monitoring, continuous healthTriboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are able to convert low -frequency biomechanical motions into characteristically high-voltage and low-current electrical signals via a coupling of contact electrification and electrostatic induction. Resulting from a unique working principle, TENGs hold a collection of compelling features, including light weight, structural simplicity, cost-effectiveness, biocompatibility, and a wide range of soft materials choices.

Recent efforts have focused on engineering electronics from soft materials-elastomers, polyelectrolyte gels and liquid metal. While these materials enable elastic compliance and deformability, they are vulnerable to tearing, puncture and other mechanical damage modes that cause electrical failure. Here, we introduce a material architecture for soft and highly deformable circuit interconnects that are electromechanically stable under typical loading conditions, while exhibiting uncompromising resilience to mechanical damage. The material is composed of liquid metal droplets suspended in a soft elastomer; when damaged, the droplets rupture to form new connections with neighbours and re-route electrical signals without interruption. Since self-healing occurs spontaneously, these materials do not require manual repair or external heat. We demonstrate this unprecedented electronic robustness in a self-repairing digital counter and self-healing soft robotic quadruped that continue to function after significant damage.									547	23	0	0	36	0	551			1476-1122	1476-4660											2018-07-01	WOS:000436341400016	29784995

In this work, enhancement of the strength and load transfer capabilities of CNT networks by chemical vapor deposition of graphene in the nanotube voids is proposed. The graphene hybridization significantly strengthens the CNT networks, especially at nanotube joints, and enhances their resistance to buckling and bundling under large cyclic strain up to 20%. The hybridized films show linear and reproducible responses to tensile strains, which have been applied in strain sensors to detect human motions with fast response, high sensitivity, and durability.									298	21	1	0	15	0	307			1616-301X	1616-3028											2016-04-05	WOS:000373738000003

However, because of the poor sustainability of the active materials in complex stress environments, new requirements have been adopted for the construction of flexible devices. Thus, hierarchical architectures in natural materials, which have developed various environment-adapted structures and materials through natural selection, can serve as guides to solve the limitations of materials and engineering techniques. This review covers the smart designs of structural materials inspired by natural materials and their utility in the construction of flexible devices. First, we summarize structural materials that accommodate mechanical deformations, which is the fundamental requirement for flexible devices to work properly in complex environments. Second, we discuss the functionalities of flexible devices induced by nature-inspired structural materials, including mechanical sensing, energy harvesting, physically interacting, and so on. Finally, we provide a perspective on newly developed structural materials and their potential applications in future flexible devices, as well as frontier strategies for biomimetic functions. These analyses and valuable for a systematic understanding of structural materials in electronic devices and will serve as inspirations for smart designs in flexible electronics.									470	22	0	0	44	0	476			0009-2665	1520-6890											2017-10-25	WOS:000413992600007	28991450

Titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx), in particular, has shown significant energy-storage capability. However, previously, only micrometer-thick, nontransparent films were studied. Here, highly transparent and conductive Ti3C2Tx films and their application as transparent, solid-state supercapacitors are reported. Transparent films are fabricated via spin-casting of Ti3C2Tx nanosheet colloidal solutions, followed by vacuum annealing at 200 degrees C. Films with transmittance of 93% (approximate to 4 nm) and 29% (approximate to 88 nm) demonstrate DC conductivity of approximate to 5736 and approximate to 9880 S cm(-1), respectively. Such highly transparent, conductive Ti3C2Tx films display impressive volumetric capacitance (676 F cm(-3)) combined with fast response. Transparent solid-state, asymmetric supercapacitors (72% transmittance) based on Ti3C2Tx and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are also fabricated. These electrodes exhibit high capacitance (1.6 mF cm(-2)) and energy density (0.05 mu W h cm(-2)), and long lifetime (no capacitance decay over 20 000 cycles), exceeding that of graphene or SWCNT-based transparent supercapacitor devices. Collectively, the Ti3C2Tx films are among the state-of-the-art for future transparent, conductive, capacitive electrodes, and translate into technologically viable devices for next-generation wearable, portable electronics.									700	41	0	0	38	0	710			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-09-27	WOS:000411379000027	28741695

Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing (CC) architectures are utilized in the development of smart healthcare systems. These entities can support real-time applications by exploiting massive volumes of data, produced by wearable sensor devices. The advent of evolutionary computation algorithms and Deep Learning (DL) models has gained significant attention in healthcare diagnosis, especially in decision making process. Skin cancer is the deadliest disease which affects people across the globe. Automatic skin lesion classification model has a highly important application due to its fine-grained variability in the presence of skin lesions. The current research article presents a new skin lesion diagnosis model i.e., Deep Learning with Evolutionary Algorithm based Image Segmentation (DL-EAIS) for IoT and cloud-based smart healthcare environments. Primarily, the dermoscopic images are captured using IoT devices, which are then transmitted to cloud servers for further diagnosis. Besides, Backtracking Search optimization Algorithm (BSA) with Entropy-Based Thresholding (EBT) i.e., BSA-EBT technique is applied in image segmentation. Followed by, Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) model is utilized as a feature extractor. In addition, Deep-Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (D-KELM) model is employed as a classification model to determine the class labels of dermoscopic images. An extensive set of simulations was conducted to validate the performance of the presented method using benchmark dataset. The experimental outcome infers that the proposed model demonstrated optimal performance over the compared techniques under diverse measures.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1546-2218	1546-2226											2021-09-25	WOS:000696956000033

Herein, we report a facile strategy for crafting wrinkled MoS2/N-doped carbon core/shell nanospheres interfaced with single Fe atoms (denoted MoS2@Fe-N-C) as superior ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts for robust wearable ZABs with a high capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Specifically, the highly crumpled MoS2 nanosphere core is wrapped with a layer of single-Fe-atom-impregnated, N-doped carbon shell (i.e., Fe-N-C shell with well-dispersed FeN4 sites). Intriguingly, MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres manifest an ORR half-wave potential of 0.84 V and an OER overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2). More importantly, density functional theory calculations reveal the lowered energy barriers for both ORR and OER, accounting for marked enhanced catalytic performance of MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres. Remarkably, wearable ZABs assembled by capitalizing on MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres as an air electrode with an ultralow area loading (i.e., 0.25 mg.cm(-2)) display excellent stability against deformation, high special capacity (i.e., 442 mAh.g(Zn)(-1)), excellent power density (i.e., 78 mW.cm(-2)) and attractive cycling stability (e.g., 50 cycles at current density of 5 mA.cm(-2)). This study provides a platform to rationally design single-atom-interfaced core/shell bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient metal-air batteries.									72	3	0	0	5	0	72			0027-8424												2021-11-02	WOS:000710708300006	34588309

Herein, intrinsically ultrastretchable, self-healing and transparent humidity sensors composed of ionic -carrageenan/polyacrylamide (PAM) double network (DN) organohydrogels are fabricated via a facile solvent-exchange strategy. Hygroscopic ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol (Gly) are introduced in the organohydrogels to promote both anti-drying and humidity sensing capabilities. The organohydrogel sensors display unprecedented stretchability (1225% strain) and excellent sensing performance, including fast response (0.27 s) and recovery time (0.3 s), wide relative humidity (RH) detection range (4-90%), stability and linearity. The conductance of Gly-DN sensors increases more than 543 times with increasing RH from 4% to 90%. With sufficient sensitivity, the humidity sensors can monitor human respiration with stable and repeatable output. The enhanced sensitivity and moisture-holding ability are attributed to the ready formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and enormous hydrophilic groups, including -OH, SO3- and -NH2, in the elaborate polymer networks and binary solvent. The hindering effect of polymer chains on the transport of conductive ions plays a key role in producing a transducing signal, which is proposed as the mechanism of the novel sensors.									247	12	0	0	27	0	249			2051-6347	2051-6355											2019-03-01	WOS:000462637900012

Great progress has been achieved in developing organic materials with high TE performance (figure of merit, ZT) over the past decade. However, it is still extremely challenging to obtain organic materials with high TE performance and a ZT over 0.5 because of the strong interrelationship between the three TE parameters: electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. In this review, we discuss current trends in developing strategies to decouple the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which to the best of our knowledge have not been discussed in previously published reviews. Methods such as solvent treatment, electrochemical doping, and nanostructure formation are analyzed. In addition, incorrect thermal conductivity values for highly electrically conducting organic materials are still frequently reported, even in papers published in high-impact journals. A description of this puzzling phenomenon is provided in this review. Finally, a discussion of the advantages of state-of-the-art fabrication techniques of organic TE modules is presented, which highlights the unique advantages of organic TE materials in supporting wearable/portable devices.									149	5	0	0	10	0	150			2542-4351												2019-01-16	WOS:000457552800008

However, to combine the properties of autonomous self-healing property, high conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and stimuli-responsive properties for hydrogel is still a great challenge. Herein, we present self-healing conductive hydrogels based on beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and nanostructured polypyrrole (PPY). Among them, beta-CD served as the host molecule, and NIPAM served as the guest molecule, CNT as the physical cross-linker and conducting substrate, and PPY as the highly conductive component, respectively. The obtained hydrogels exhibit high conductivity, self-healing property, flexible and elastic mechanical property and rapid stimuli-responsive property both to temperature and near-infrared (NIR)-light together. The excellent characteristics of the hydrogels are further illustrated by pressure-dependent sensors, large-scale human motion monitoring sensors and self-healable electronic circuit. Cytotoxicity test indicated that they are nontoxic to L929 fibroblast cells and C2C12 myoblast cells. Taken together, these multifunctional hydrogels are excellent candidates for stimuli responsive electrical devices, artificial organs, and so on.									406	18	0	0	89	0	413			0897-4756	1520-5002											2018-03-13	WOS:000427661500033

The sensor is made of a hyperelastic silicone elastomer that contains embedded microchannels filled with conductive liquids. This is an effort of improving the previously reported soft sensors that uses a single liquid conductor. The proposed sensor employs a hybrid approach involving two liquid conductors: an ionic solution and an eutectic gallium-indium alloy. This hybrid method reduces the sensitivity to noise that may be caused by variations in electrical resistance of the wire interface and undesired stress applied to signal routing areas. The bridge between these two liquids is made conductive by doping the elastomer locally with nickel nanoparticles. The design, fabrication, and characterization of the sensor are presented.									248	5	0	0	17	0	250			1530-437X	1558-1748											2013-09-01	WOS:000323217400011

This detector interfaces with a smartphone (or a tablet) using "Bluetooth Low Energy" protocol; the smartphone provides (i) a user interface for receiving the experimental parameters from the user and visualizing the result in real time, and (ii) a proxy for storing, processing, and transmitting the data and experimental protocols. This approach simplifies the design, and decreases both the size and the cost of the hardware; it also makes the UWED adaptable to different types of analyses by simple modification of the software. The UWED can perform the most common electroanalytical techniques of potentiometry, chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and square wave voltammetry, with results closely comparable to benchtop commercial potentiostats. Although the operating ranges of electrical current and voltage of the UWED (+/- 1.5 V, +/- 180 mu A) are more limited than most benchtop commercial potentiostats, its functional range is sufficient for most electrochemical analyses in aqueous solutions. Because the UWED is simple, small in size, assembled from inexpensive components, and completely wireless, it offers new opportunities for the development of affordable diagnostics, sensors, and wearable devices.									192	3	0	0	55	1	193			0003-2700	1520-6882											2018-12-28	WOS:000432478600038	29658268

They belong to the portable analytical class of biosensors for monitoring biomarkers in the human body. They contain ion-sensitive membranes sensors can be used to determine potassium, sodium, and chloride ions activity while being used as a biomarker to gauge human health. The potentiometric based ion-sensitive membrane systems can be coupled with various techniques to create a sensitive tool for the fast and early detection of cancer biomarkers and other critical biological compounds. This paper discusses the application of potentiometric-based biosensors and classifies them into four major categories: photoelectrochemical potentiometric biomarkers, potentiometric biosensors amplified with molecular imprinted polymer systems, wearable potentiometric biomarkers and light-addressable potentiometric biosensors. This review demonstrated the development of several innovative biosensor-based techniques that could potentially provide reliable tools to test biomarkers. Some challenges however remain, but these can be removed by coupling techniques to maximize the testing sensitivity.									324	1	0	0	84	0	324			0956-5663	1873-4235											2021-04-23	WOS:000649740600005	33895688

Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the 'black-box' criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated ('labelled') data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.									135	2	0	0	36	0	137			0195-668X	1522-9645											2019-10-24	WOS:000490138100016	30815669

We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2398-6352												2022-01-18	WOS:000741368000001	35017634

Although having broader potential applications, producing stable aqueous inks of liquid metals keeps challenging because of rapid oxidation of liquid metal when exposing to water and oxygen. Here, a biocompatible aqueous ink is produced by encapsulating alloy nanodroplets of gallium and indium (EGaIn) into microgels of marine polysaccharides. During sonicating bulk EGaIn in aqueous alginate solution, alginate not only facilitates the downsizing process via coordination of their carboxyl groups with Ga ions but also forms microgel shells around EGaIn droplets. Due to the deceasing oxygen-permeability of microgel shells, aqueous ink of EGaIn nanodroplets can maintain colloidal and chemical stability for a period of >7 d. Crosslinked alginate-gel with tunable thickness can retard the generation and release of toxic cations, thereby affording high biocompatibility. The soft alginate shells also enable to recover electric conductivity of EGaIn layers by mechanical sintering for applications in microcircuits, electric-thermal actuators, and wearable sensors, offering huge potential for electronic tattoos, artificial limbs, electric skins, etc.									248	7	0	0	18	1	250			1616-301X	1616-3028											2018-12-28	WOS:000445327300027

Further, simulation plays a very important role in the healthcare field, especially in research on medical pathway planning, medical resource allocation, medical activity prediction, etc. By combining digital twin and healthcare, there will be a new and efficient way to provide more accurate and fast services for elderly healthcare. However, how to achieve personal health management throughout the entire lifecycle of elderly patients, and how to converge the medical physical world and the virtual world to realize real smart healthcare, are still two key challenges in the era of precision medicine. In this paper, a framework of the cloud healthcare system is proposed based on digital twin healthcare (CloudDTH). This is a novel, generalized, and extensible framework in the cloud environment for monitoring, diagnosing and predicting aspects of the health of individuals using, for example, wearable medical devices, toward the goal of personal health management, especially for the elderly. CloudDTH aims to achieve interaction and convergence between medical physical and virtual spaces. Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin healthcare (DTH) is proposed and discussed, and a DTH model is implemented. Next, a reference framework of CloudDTH based on DTH is constructed, and its key enabling technologies are explored. Finally, the feasibility of some application scenarios and a case study for real-time supervision are demonstrated.									172	6	0	0	8	0	176			2169-3536												2019-05-27	WOS:000467170400001

Some evidence suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback might be an effective way to treat anxiety and stress symptoms. To examine the effect of HRV biofeedback on symptoms of anxiety and stress, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library.Methods. The search identified 24 studies totaling 484 participants who received HRV biofeedback training for stress and anxiety. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis.Results. The pre-post within-group effect size (Hedges' g) was 0.81. The between-groups analysis comparing biofeedback to a control condition yielded Hedges' g = 0.83. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by study year, risk of study bias, percentage of females, number of sessions, or presence of an anxiety disorder.Conclusions. HRV biofeedback training is associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress and anxiety. Although more well-controlled studies are needed, this intervention offers a promising approach for treating stress and anxiety with wearable devices.									218	1	3	0	71	1	222			0033-2917	1469-8978											2017-11-01	WOS:000413164800002	28478782

In recent years, the gas sensing devices have made great achievement and also created wide application prospects, which leads to a new wave of research for designing advanced sensing materials. There is no doubt that the characteristics are highly governed by the sensitive layers. For this reason, important advances for the outstanding, novel sensing materials with different dimensional structures including 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D are reported and summarized systematically. The sensing materials cover noble metals, metal oxide semiconductors, carbon nanomaterials, metal dichalcogenides, g-C3N4, MXenes, and complex composites.

Cloud computing offers services at the infrastructure level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency, and delay that is caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for real-time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed. The first and most critical problem is designing resource management techniques that determine which modules of analytics applications are pushed to each edge device to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput. To this end, we need an evaluation platform that enables the quantification of performance of resource management policies on an IoT or Fog computing infrastructure in a repeatable manner. In this paper we propose a simulator, called iFogSim, to model IoT and Fog environments and measure the impact of resource management techniques in latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and cost. We describe two case studies to demonstrate modeling of an IoT environment and comparison of resource management policies. Moreover, scalability of the simulation toolkit of RAM consumption and execution time is verified under different circumstances.									706	7	0	0	4	0	713			0038-0644	1097-024X											2017-09-01	WOS:000407204300006

The drying conducting polymer on Ag nanowire percolation network is used as a nanosoldering material inducing strong capillary-force-assisted stiction of the nanowires to other nanowires or to the substrate to enhance the electrical conductivity, mechanical stability, and adhesion to the substrate of the nanowire percolation network without the conventional high-temperature annealing step. Highly bendable Ag nanowire/conducting polymer hybrid films with low sheet resistance and high transmittance are demonstrated on a plastic substrate. The fabricated flexible transparent electrode maintains its conductivity over 20 000 cyclic bends and 5 to 10% stretching. Finally, a large area (A4-size) transparent conductor and a flexible touch panel on a non-flat surface are fabricated to demonstrate the possibility of cost-effective mass production as well as the applicability to the unconventional arbitrary soft surfaces. These results suggest that this is an important step toward producing intelligent and multifunctional soft electric devices as friendly human/electronics interface, and it may ultimately contribute to the applications in wearable computers.									427	26	0	0	28	1	435			1616-301X	1616-3028											2013-09-14	WOS:000327492500001

The device shows a large on/ off current ratio (up to 7.36 x10(6)), outstanding detection sensitivity (6.82 x10(13 )Jones), and fast response (6.9/ 6.4 ms) at 325 nm illumination at a bias voltage of 0 V, also exhibiting a relatively broad spectral response, remarkable reproducibility under thousands of switching cycles, and superior mechanical stability. In addition, since both GaN and ZnO are piezoelectric semiconductor materials, the piezoelectric charges created at two sides of heterojunction interface under an external strain will regulate the separation, extraction and recombination of photo-generated carriers based on the piezo-phototronic effect, resulting in an enhancement of relative responsivity up to 22% with a compressive strain of -0.48% under UV illumination of 38.4 mW/cm(2). This work not only exhibits a self-powered flexible optoelectronic device with potential applications in photo-sensing for artificial skin, optical communication, and self-powered integrated systems, but also provides a strategy to optimize the performance of prospective optoelectronic sensors via the piezo-phototronic effect.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			2211-2855	2211-3282											2022-04-25	WOS:000782175400002

Here we demonstrate weavable, sewable, knottable and braidable yarns that function as high performance electrodes of redox supercapacitors. A novel technology, gradient biscrolling, provides fastion-transport yarn in which hundreds of layers of conducting-polymer-infiltrated carbon nanotube sheet are scrolled into similar to 20 mu m diameter yarn. Plying the biscrolled yarn with a metal wire current collector increases power generation capabilities. The volumetric capacitance is high (up to similar to 179 Fcm(-3)) and the discharge current of the plied yarn supercapacitor linearly increases with voltage scan rate up to similar to 80 Vs(-1) and similar to 20 Vs(-1) for liquid and solid electrolytes, respectively. The exceptionally high energy and power densities for the complete supercapacitor, and high cycle life that little depends on winding or sewing (92%, 99% after 10,000 cycles, respectively) are important for the applications in electronic textiles.									459	19	0	0	34	0	466			2041-1723												2013-09-18	WOS:000323624100038	23733169

The enzyme (uricase)-modified screen printed electrode system has been integrated onto a mouthguard platform along with anatomically-miniaturized instrumentation electronics featuring a potentiostat, microcontroller, and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver. Unlike REID-based biosensing systems, which require large proximal power sources, the developed platform enables real-time wireless transmission of the sensed information to standard smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics for on-demand processing, diagnostics, or storage. The mouthguard biosensor system offers high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability towards uric acid detection in human saliva, covering the concentration ranges for both healthy people and hyperuricemia patients. The new wireless mouthguard biosensor system is able to monitor SUA level in real-time and continuous fashion, and can be readily expanded to an array of sensors for different analytes to enable an attractive wearable monitoring system for diverse health and fitness applications.

Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), which can provide high power density and a long lifetime, are ideal stand-alone power sources for smart microelectronics. However, relatively few MSCs exhibit both high areal and volumetric capacitance. Here rapid production of flexible MSCs is demonstrated through a scalable, low-cost stamping strategy. Combining 3D-printed stamps with arbitrary shapes and 2D titanium carbide or carbonitride inks (Ti3C2Tx and Ti3CNTx, respectively, known as MXenes), flexible all-MXene MSCs with controlled architectures are produced. The interdigitated Ti3C2Tx MSC exhibits high areal capacitance: 61 mF cm(-2) at 25 mu A cm(-2) and 50 mF cm(-2) as the current density increases by 32 fold. The Ti3C2Tx MSCs also showcase capacitive charge storage properties, good cycling lifetime, high energy and power densities, etc. The production of such high-performance Ti3C2Tx MSCs can be easily scaled up by designing pad or cylindrical stamps, followed by a cold rolling process. Collectively, the rapid, efficient production of flexible all-MXene MSCs with state-of-the-art performance opens new exciting opportunities for future applications in wearable and portable electronics.									416	30	0	0	13	0	419			1616-301X	1616-3028											2018-02-28	WOS:000426154500016

However, practical applications of flexible supercapacitors are still limited by the relatively poor performances. Herein, the hierarchical carbon cloth@CoMoO4@NiCo-LDH core-shell nanowire arrays supported have been synthesized via a facile two-step hydrothermal route coupled with annealing treatment. In addition, a possible mechanism for the growth of NiCo-LDH nanosheets (NSs) shell onto CoMoO4 nanowires (NWs) core is put forward based on the time-dependent experiments. The CC@CoMoO4@NiCo-LDH-12 h electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2024 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), with 80.3% retention of the initial specific capacitance at 20 A g(-1) and outstanding cycling stability. In addition, we have fabricated a flexible all-solidstate asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) which achieves a maximum energy density of 59.5 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1) and long-term cycling stability (89.7% device capacitance retention over 5000 cycles). The remarkable electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the rational combination of two electroactive materials and the reasonable array configuration.									221	5	0	0	23	0	225			1385-8947	1873-3212											2018-11-15	WOS:000444001900004

Herein, the first paradigm of a high-performance and stable flexible rechargeable quasi-solid-state Zn-MnO2 battery is constructed by engineering MnO2 electrodes and gel electrolyte. Benefiting from a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) buffer layer and a Mn2+-based neutral electrolyte, the fabricated Zn-MnO2@PEDOT battery presents a remarkable capacity of 366.6 mA h g(-1) and good cycling performance (83.7% after 300 cycles) in aqueous electrolyte. More importantly, when using PVA/ZnCl2/MnSO4 gel as electrolyte, the as-fabricated quasi-solid-state Zn-MnO2@PEDOT battery remains highly rechargeable, maintaining more than 77.7% of its initial capacity and nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency after 300 cycles. Moreover, this flexible quasi-solid-state Zn-MnO2 battery achieves an admirable energy density of 504.9 W h kg(-1) (33.95 mW h cm(-3)), together with a peak power density of 8.6 kW kg(-1), substantially higher than most recently reported flexible energy-storage devices.

Consequently, recent focus has been placed on developing self-powered IOB therapeutic devices capable of generating therapeutic ES for human use. With the recent invention of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), harnessing passive human biomechanical energy to develop self-powered systems has allowed for the introduction of novel therapeutic ES solutions. TENGs are especially effective at providing ES for IOB therapeutic systems given their bioconformability, low cost, simple manufacturability, and self-powering capabilities. Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, TENG-induced ES holds promise to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic interventions. The aim here is to detail research on IOB TENG devices applied for ES-based therapy in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering. Furthermore, considering TENG-produced ES can be measured for sensing applications, this technology is paving the way to provide a fully autonomous personalized healthcare system, capable of IOB energy generation, sensing, and therapeutic intervention. Considering these grounds, it seems highly relevant to review TENG-ES research and applications, as they could constitute the foundation and future of personalized healthcare.									78	1	0	0	5	0	78			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-05-25	WOS:000652275700001	34014583

Herein, a flexible electrically conductive polymer foam composite (CPFC) with the lotus leaf inspired microstructure is prepared by anchoring carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto the skeleton of the polymer foam with the assistance of ultrasonication and simultaneous non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). Hemisphere arrays are produced on the skeleton of the polymer foam, while CNTs are decorated on the surface of these arrays, forming conductive network. The obtained superhydrophobic CPFC exhibits excellent anti-corrosive and photothermal conversion performance, making it possible to be used in some harsh environment. When used as the piezoresistive sensor, the CPFC exhibits stable electrical conductivity, extremely high compressibility and linear working range (up to 90%), superb sensing stability and durability (over 2300 cycles). Furthermore, the piezoresistive sensing performance is impervious to the ambient temperature, and the CPFC sensor can work in the temperature from -20 degrees C similar to 80 degrees C with stable sensing signals. Also, the CPFC can detect various human body movements even in the corrosive condition.									53	6	0	0	10	0	54			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-03-16	WOS:000623281800002

To achieve this ambitious goal, it is imperative for electronics to be wearable, environmentally sustainable, and safe. However, large-scale manufacture of self-sufficient electronic systems by exploiting multifunctional materials still faces significant hurdles. Herein, multitasking aqueous printable MXene inks are reported as an additive-free high-capacitance electrode, sensitive pressure-sensing material, highly conducting current collector, metal-free interconnector, and conductive binder. By directly screen printing MXene inks, MXene-based micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) and lithium-ion microbatteries (LIMBs) are delicately fabricated on various substrates. The as-prepared MSCs exhibit ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1.1 F cm(-2) and the serially connected MSCs offer a record voltage of 60 V. The quasi-solid-state LIMBs deliver a robust areal energy density of 154 mu Wh cm(-2). Furthermore, an all-flexible self-powered integrated system on a single substrate based on the multitasking MXene inks is demonstrated through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, the LIMB, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor. Notably, this integrated system is exceptionally sensitive to body movements with a fast response time of 35 ms. Therefore, this multipurpose MXene ink opens a new avenue for powering future smart appliances.									131	12	0	0	4	0	132			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-02-01	WOS:000613240200001	33522037

Recently, PLA has been used as the polymer substrate to fabricate green and flexible supercapacitors (SCs). However, the intrinsic fracture textile and limited electroactive materials deposited on the PLA substrate resulting in poor energy storage performance still remain challenging. Herein, a facile approach has been proposed to prepare flexible, yet robust electrodes of polyaniline coated on foamed PLA (PANI-fo-PLA). Aniline monomers were directly polymerized on the porous foamed PLA (fo-PLA) which was prepared via a simple nonsolvent-induced-phase-separation (NIPS) method. The fo-PLA endows the PANI-fo-PLA electrode with superior flexibility (a fracture strain of 34.70%) and high mechanical strength (a fracture strength of 77.80 MPa) which are significantly higher than those values of solvent-cast PLA films; meanwhile, the porous structure provides rich sites for the growth of PANI, which thus significantly increases the loadings of electroactive materials, and facilitates the ion transportation during the energy storage process. Employing PVA/H2SO4 as the gel electrolyte, the symmetric PANI-fo-PLA//PANI-fo-PLA SC delivers a high areal capacitance of 27.73 mF cm(-2) (@0.05 mA cm(-2)), which is more than one hundred times higher than that of the SC based on electrodes of PANI grown on non-porous PLA film. The SC retains 66.29% of its original capacitance even bent at 90 degrees, demonstrating its great potentials for flexible wearable electronics.

Although its first generation has revolutionized conventional lenses and enabled anomalous refraction, new classes of meta-optics can now shape light and dark features of an optical field with an unprecedented level of complexity and multifunctionality. Here, we review these efforts with a focus on metasurfaces that use different properties of input light-angle of incidence and direction, polarization, phase distribution, wavelength, and nonlinear behavior-as optical knobs for tuning the output response. We discuss ongoing advances in this area as well as future challenges and prospects. These recent developments indicate that optically tunable flat optics is poised to advance adaptive camera systems, microscopes, holograms, and portable and wearable devices and may suggest new possibilities in optical communications and sensing.									53	2	0	0	1	0	55			0036-8075	1095-9203											2022-05-13	WOS:000788553700031	35446661

Consequently, a wide variety of IoT applications have been developed and deployed using different IoT frameworks. An IoT framework is a set of guiding rules, protocols, and standards which simplify the implementation of IoT applications. The success of these applications mainly depends on the ecosystem characteristics of the IoT framework, with the emphasis on the security mechanisms employed in it, where issues related to security and privacy are pivotal. In this paper, we survey the security of the main IoT frameworks, a total of 8 frameworks are considered. For each framework, we clarify the proposed architecture, the essentials of developing third-party smart apps, the compatible hardware, and the security features.

The fabricated microstructure consists of an interconnected network of graphene and carbon nanotubes with magnetic Fe3O4 particles as the fast transport channel of charge carriers for high electrical conductivity. Building upon this unique network structure, we demonstrate the superb potential for its application as electromagnetic wave absorbing material. The minimum reflection loss of the CNT film-Fe3O4-rGO-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite with 4 layers is -50.5 dB and absorption bandwidth at -10 dB is 5.7 GHz, respectively, the thickness of this material is only 1.42 mm. Long-term cycling tests in bending and twisting deformations show >93% retention of EM wave absorption after 2000 cycles.

AbstractLow cost and green fabrication of high-performance electrocatalysts with earth-abundant resources for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the large-scale application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). In this work, our density functional theory calculations on the electrocatalyst suggest that the rational construction of interfacial structure can induce local charge redistribution, improve the electronic conductivity and enhance the catalyst stability. In order to realize such a structure, we spatially immobilize heterogeneous CoS/CoO nanocrystals onto N-doped graphene to synthesize a bifunctional electrocatalyst (CoS/CoO@NGNs). The optimization of the composition, interfacial structure and conductivity of the electrocatalyst is conducted to achieve bifunctional catalytic activity and deliver outstanding efficiency and stability for both ORR and OER. The aqueous ZAB with the as-prepared CoS/CoO@NGNs cathode displays a high maximum power density of 137.8 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 723.9 mAh g(-1) and excellent cycling stability (continuous operating for 100 h) with a high round-trip efficiency.

ZIBs with solid-state polymer electrolytes can not only maintain additional load-bearing properties, but exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties by preventing dendrite formation and inhibiting cathode dissolution. Substantial efforts have been applied to polymer electrolytes by developing solid polymer electrolytes, hydrogel polymer electrolytes, and hybrid polymer electrolytes; however, the research of polymer electrolytes for ZIBs is still immature. Herein, the recent progress in polymer electrolytes is summarized by category for flexible ZIBs, especially hydrogel electrolytes, including their synthesis and characterization. Aiming to provide an insight from lab research to commercialization, the relevant challenges, device configurations, and life cycle analysis are consolidated. As flexible batteries, the majority of polymer electrolytes exploited so far only emphasizes the electrochemical performance but the mechanical behavior and interactions with the electrode materials have hardly been considered. Hence, strategies of combining softness and strength and the integration with electrodes are discussed for flexible ZIBs. A ranking index, combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties, is introduced. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward the commercialization of flexible ZIBs.									114	7	0	0	1	0	115			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-04-08	WOS:000635972100001	33797810

In addition to the hydrophobicity, anti-oxidation and extreme-temperature stability, efficient utilization of the intrinsic conductivity of MXene, the interfacial polarization between MXene and PI, and the micrometer-sized pores of the composite foams are achieved. Consequently, the composites show a satisfactory X-band electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of 22.5 to 62.5 dB at a density of 28.7 to 48.7 mg cm(-3) leading to an excellent surface-specific SE of 21,317 dB cm(2) g(-1). Moreover, the composite foams exhibit excellent electrothermal performance as flexible heaters in terms of a prominent, rapid reproducible, and stable electrothermal effect at low voltages and superior heat performance and more uniform heat distribution compared with the commercial heaters composed of alloy plates. Furthermore, the composite foams are well attached on a human body to check their electromechanical sensing performance, demonstrating the sensitive and reliable detection of human motions as wearable sensors. The excellent EMI shielding performance and multifunctionalities, along with the facile and easy-to-scalable manufacturing techniques, imply promising perspectives of the porous C-MXene@PI composites in next-generation flexible electronics, aerospace, and smart devices.									80	11	0	0	3	0	81			2311-6706	2150-5551											2022-02-26	WOS:000753413800001	35138506

Present artificial skins can be characterized into electronic skins (e-skins) that convert external stimuli into electrical signals and photonic skins (p-skins) that convert deformations into intuitive optical feedback. Merging both electronic and photonic functions in a single skin is highly desirable, but challenging and remains yet unexplored. We report herein a brand-new type of artificial intelligent skin, an optoelectronic skin (o-skin), which combines the advantages of both e-skins and p-skins in a single skin device based on one-dimensional photonic crystal-based hydrogels. Taking advantage of its anisotropic characteristics, the resulting o-skin can easily distinguish vector stimuli such as stress type and movement direction to meet the needs of multi-dimensional perception. Furthermore, the o-skin also demonstrates advanced functions such as full-color displays and intelligent response to the environment in the form of self-adaptive camouflage. This work represents a substantial advance in using the molecular engineering strategy to achieve artificial intelligent skins with multiple anisotropic responses that can be integrated on the skin of a soft body to endow superior functions, just like the natural organisms that inspire us.									26	3	0	0	0	0	26			1931-9401												2022-05-12	WOS:000790478500001

In this context, radio technology can be widely employed since, other than connecting devices in the home system, it offers solutions for the user localization issue without the need of any extra device. Techniques based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) are often used, relying on fingerprinting or proximity algorithms. In this paper, a novel RSSI-based fingerprinting approach for room-level localization is presented: it is a threshold algorithm based on receiver operating characteristic analysis. Moreover, the actual user location is estimated from his/her interaction with the home system devices deployed in the house: if the home environment is inhabited by more than one person, it becomes of utmost importance the identification of who is actually interacting with a given device. A proximity method is exploited for this purpose. Tests have been carried out to characterize the approach, particularly, the effects of RSSI samples, number and position, of the anchor nodes have been analyzed. Finally, some considerations about power consumption of the mobile node have been presented.									142	9	0	0	3	0	153			0018-9456	1557-9662											2019-01-10	WOS:000454332000025

Most existing conductive fibers are electron-based, opaque, relatively rigid, and show a significant increase in resistance during stretching. Accordingly, soft, stretchable, and transparent ion-conductive hydrogel fibers have attracted significant attention. However, hydrogel fibers are difficult to manufacture and easy to dry and freeze, which significantly hinders their wide range of applications. Herein, organohydrogel fibers are designed to address these challenges. First, a newly designed hybrid crosslinking strategy continuously wet-spins hydrogel fibers, which are transformed into organohydrogel fibers by simple solvent replacement. The organohydrogel fibers show excellent antifreezing (< -80 degrees C) capability, stability (>5 months), transparency, and stretchability. The predominantly covalently crosslinked network ensures the fibers have a high dynamic mechanical stability with negligible hysteresis and creep, from which previous conductive fibers usually suffer. Accordingly, strain sensors made from the organohydrogel fibers accurately capture high-frequency (4 Hz) and high-speed (24 cm s(-1)) motion and exhibit little drift for 1000 stretch-release cycles, and are powerful for detecting rapid cyclic motions such as engine valves and are difficult to reach by previously reported conductive fibers. The organohydrogel fibers also demonstrate potential as wearable anisotropic sensors, data gloves, soft electrodes, and optical fibers.									157	10	0	0	15	0	158			0935-9648	1521-4095											2020-01-19	WOS:000507947600001	31957099

Solutions to this issue have mostly focused on the design of cathode hosts with a polar, sulfurphilic, conductive network, or the introduction of an extra layer to suppress LIPS shuttling, which either results in complex fabrication procedures or compromises the mechanical flexibility of the device. A robust Ti3C2Tx/S conductive paper combining the excellent conductivity, mechanical strength, and unique chemisorption of LiPSs from MXene nanosheets is reported. Importantly, repeated cycling initiates the in situ formation of a thick sulfate complex layer on the MXene surface, which acts as a protective membrane, effectively suppressing the shuttling of LiPSs and improving the utilization of sulfur. Consequently, the Ti3C2Tx/S paper exhibits a high capacity and an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.014% after 1500 cycles, the lowest value reported for Li-S batteries to date. A robust prototype pouch cell and full cell of Ti3C2Tx/S paper//lithium foil and prelithiated germanium are also demonstrated. The preliminary results show that Ti3C2Tx/S paper holds great promise for future flexible and wearable electronics.									169	17	0	0	4	0	170			1616-301X	1616-3028											2019-07-01	WOS:000478612000024

However, conventional conductive hydrogels usually exhibit insufficient mechanical strength and adhesion. In addition, they will lose flexibility and conductivity under subzero temperature and a dry environment owing to inevitable freezing and evaporation of water. In this study, a tough, flexible, self-adhesive, long-term moisturizing, and antifreezing organohydrogel was prepared, which was composed of gelatin, zwitterionic poly [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) (PSBMA), MXene nanosheets, and glycerol. Natural gelatin was incorporated to enhance mechanical performance via the entanglement of a physical cross-linked network and a PSBMA network, which was also used as a stabilizer to disperse MXene into the organohydrogel. Zwitterionic PSBMA endowed the organohydrogel with good adhesion and self-healing properties. Long-term moisturizing properties and antifreeze tolerance could be achieved owing to the synergistic water retention capacity of PSBMA and glycerol. The resulting PSBMA-gelatin-MXene-glycerol (PGMG) organohydrogel exhibited high mechanical fracture strength (0.65 MPa) and stretchability (over 1000%), excellent toughness (3.87 MJ/m(3)), strong and repeated adhesion to diverse substrates (e.g., paper, glass, silicon rubber, iron, and pig skin), good fatigue resistance (under the cyclic stretching-releasing process), and rapid recovery capacity. Moreover, the PGMG organohydrogel showed good stability under -40 degrees C. The sensor based on PGMG organohydrogel could tightly attach to the human skin and real-time-monitor the motions of joints (e.g., bending of the finger, wrist, elbow, and knee) and the change in mood such as smiling and frowning. Therefore, PGMG organohydrogels have a huge potential for wearable sensors under room temperature or extreme environments.									22	0	0	0	3	0	22			1525-7797	1526-4602											2022-06-26	WOS:000812733000001	35171559

Through electrospinning technique, we prepared an aligned TPU fibrous mat, then used a simple and effective assembly approach to induce CNTs to wrap TPU fibrous mat through ultrasonication. The sensing properties of CNTs/TPU mats in vertical and parallel directions were investigated, respectively. The sensing behaviors of the two sensors both agreed well with the tunneling theory. Compared with the random CNTs/TPU mats and parallel direction sample, the aligned CNTs/TPU fibrous mats in vertical direction possessed an ultra-high stretchability (900%) and excellent durability (10,000 cycles at the strain of 200%). An ultra-low detection limit (0.5%) and fast response time of 70 ms were also achieved, exhibiting a favorable sensitivity. The generation of the wave-like structure and the joints structure in the designed conductive network, which could affect the evolution of the conductive paths subsequently, led to these excellent sensing performances. The CNTs/TPU mats strain sensor was then assembled to monitor both subtle human motions, like cheek bulging and phonation; and vigorous human motions, like leg squatting and elbow bending, both showing excellent sensing performances. The present paper provides a good candidate for potential applications as artificial skins, human-activity monitoring and personal healthcare.									144	7	0	0	12	0	146			1385-8947	1873-3212											2019-03-28	WOS:000460964000077

Here we show magnetoelastic effect can also exist in 1D soft fibers with stronger magnetomechanical coupling than that in traditional rigid counterparts. This effect is explained by a wavy chain model based on the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and demagnetizing factor. To facilitate practical applications, we further invented a textile magnetoelastic generator (MEG), weaving the 1D soft fibers with conductive yarns to couple the observed magnetoelastic effect with magnetic induction, which paves a new way for biomechanical-to-electrical energy conversion with short-circuit current density of 0.63 mA cm(-2), internal impedance of 180 ohm, and intrinsic waterproofness. Textile MEG was demonstrated to convert the arterial pulse into electrical signals with a low detection limit of 0.05 kPa, even with heavy perspiration or in underwater situations without encapsulations.The authors invented a textile magnetoelastic generator, weaving 1D soft fibers with conductive yarns to couple the observed magnetoelastic effect with magnetic induction, which paves a new way for biomechanical-to-electrical energy conversion.									80	0	0	0	11	0	80				2041-1723											2021-12-27	WOS:000720682600009	34799591

However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve conductive hydrogel-based epidermal sensors with reliable healability for long-term usage, robust mechanical property, environmental degradability for decreased electronic waste, and sensing capability of the physiological stimuli and the electrophysiological signals. Herein, we propose the synthesis strategy of a multifunctional epidermal sensor based on the highly stretchable, self-healing, degradable, and biocompatible nanocomposite hydrogel, which is fabricated from the conformal coating of a MXene (Ti3C2Tx) network by the hydrogel polymer networks involving poly(acrylic acid) and amorphous calcium carbonate. The epidermal sensor can be employed to sensitively detect human motions with the fast response time (20 ms) and to serve as electronic skins for wirelessly monitoring the electrophysiological signals (such as the electromyogram and electrocardiogram signals). Meanwhile, the multifunctional epidermal sensor could be degraded in phosphate buffered saline solution, which could not cause any pollution to the environment. This line of research work sheds light on the fabrication of the healable, degradable, and electrophysiological signal-sensitive conductive hydrogel-based epidermal sensors with potential applications in human-machine interactions, healthy diagnosis, and smart robot prosthesis devices.									155	10	0	0	24	0	160			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-05-23	WOS:000645436800159	33769046

Here, we design a new multifunctional carbon nanotube (CNT) based capacitive strain sensors which can detect strains up to 300% with excellent durability even after thousands of cycles. The CNT-based strain gauge devices exhibit deterministic and linear capacitive response throughout the whole strain range with a gauge factor very close to the predicted value (strictly 1), representing the highest sensitivity value. The strain tests reveal the presented strain gauge with excellent dynamic sensing ability without overshoot or relaxation, and ultrafast response at sub-second scale. Coupling these superior sensing capabilities to the high transparency, physical robustness and flexibility, we believe the designed stretchable multifunctional CNT-based strain gauge may have various potential applications in human friendly and wearable smart electronics, subsequently demonstrated by our prototypical data glove and respiration monitor.									485	20	1	0	25	0	502			2045-2322												2013-10-25	WOS:000326094300002	24157842

A general sensor, especially a mobile sensor, has to be driven by a power unit. When considering the high mobility, wide distribution and wireless operation of the sensors, their sustainable operation remains a critical challenge owing to the limited lifetime of an energy storage unit. In 2006, Wang proposed the concept of self-powered sensors/system, which harvests ambient energy to continuously drive a sensor without the use of an external power source. Based on the piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), extensive studies have focused on self-powered sensors. TENG and PENG, as effective mechanical-to-electricity energy conversion technologies, have been used not only as power sources but also as active sensing devices in many application fields, including physical sensors, wearable devices, biomedical and health care, human-machine interface, chemical and environmental monitoring, smart traffic, smart cities, robotics, and fiber and fabric sensors. In this review, we systematically summarize the progress made by TENG and PENG in those application fields. A perspective will be given about the future of self-powered sensors.									135	6	0	0	3	1	135				1424-8220											2020-06-23	WOS:000539323700179	32455713

Conventional methods use manual collection processes (e.g., absorbent pads) to determine sweat loss and lab-based instrumentation to analyze its chemical composition. Although such schemes can yield accurate data, they cannot be used outside of laboratories or clinics. Recently reported wearable electrochemical devices for sweat sensing bypass these limitations, but they typically involve on-board electronics, electrodes, and/or batteries for measurement, signal processing, and wireless transmission, without direct means for measuring sweat loss or capturing and storing small volumes of sweat. Alternative approaches exploit soft, skin-integrated microfluidic systems for collection and colorimetric chemical techniques for analysis. Here, we present the most advanced platforms of this type, in which optimized chemistries, microfluidic designs, and device layouts enable accurate assessments not only of total loss of sweat and sweat rate but also of quantitatively accurate values of the pH and temperature of sweat, and of the concentrations of chloride, glucose, and lactate across physiologically relevant ranges. Color calibration markings integrated into a graphics overlayer allow precise readout by digital image analysis, applicable in various lighting conditions. Field studies conducted on healthy volunteers demonstrate the full capabilities in measuring sweat loss/rate and analyzing multiple sweat biomarkers and temperature, with performance that quantitatively matches that of conventional lab-based measurement systems.									167	8	0	0	39	0	170			2379-3694												2019-03-11	WOS:000459836400015	30707572

Despite these advantages, robots using these actuators require stretchable sensors that can be embedded in their bodies for sophisticated functions. Presently, stretchable sensors usually rely on the electrical properties of materials and composites for measuring a signal; many of these sensors suffer from hysteresis, fabrication complexity, chemical safety and environmental instability, and material incompatibility with soft actuators. Many of these issues are solved if the optical properties of materials are used for signal transduction. We report the use of stretchable optical waveguides for strain sensing in a prosthetic hand. These optoelectronic strain sensors are easy to fabricate, are chemically inert, and demonstrate low hysteresis and high precision in their output signals. As a demonstration of their potential, the photonic strain sensors were used as curvature, elongation, and force sensors integrated into a fiber-reinforced soft prosthetic hand. The optoelectronically innervated prosthetic hand was used to conduct various active sensation experiments inspired by the capabilities of a real hand. Our final demonstration used the prosthesis to feel the shape and softness of three tomatoes and select the ripe one.									486	24	0	0	15	0	496			2470-9476												2016-12-06	WOS:000441507900005	33157858

New-concept electronic devices including e-skins, nanogenerators, brain-machine interfaces, and implantable medical devices, can work on or inside human bodies, calling for wearing comfort, super flexibility, biodegradability, and stability under complex deformations. However, conventional electronics based on metal and plastic substrates cannot effectively meet these new application requirements. Therefore, a series of advanced electronic devices based on flexible porous substrates (e.g., paper, fabric, electrospun nanofibers, wood, and elastic polymer sponge) is being developed to address these challenges by virtue of their superior biocompatibility, breathability, deformability, and robustness. The porous structure of these substrates can not only improve device performance but also enable new functions, but due to their wide variety, choosing the right porous substrate is crucial for preparing high-performance electronics for specific applications. Herein, the properties of different flexible porous substrates are summarized and their basic principles of design, manufacture, and use are highlighted. Subsequently, various functionalization methods of these porous substrates are briefly introduced and compared. Then, the latest advances in flexible porous substrate-based electronics are demonstrated. Finally, the remaining challenges and future directions are discussed.									21	0	0	0	3	0	20				2198-3844											2022-03-05	WOS:000743201200001	35038244

However, a critical limitation that prevents implementing zinc chemistry at the microscale lies in its spontaneous corrosion in an acidic electrolyte that causes a capacity loss of 40% after a ten-hour rest. Widespread anti-corrosion techniques, such as polymer coating, often retard the kinetics of zinc plating/stripping and lack spatial control at the microscale. Here, a polyimide coating that resolves this dilemma is reported. The coating prevents corrosion and hence reduces the capacity loss of a standby microbattery to 10%. The coordination of carbonyl oxygen in the polyimide with zinc ions builds up over cycling, creating a zinc blanket that minimizes the concentration gradient through the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus allows for fast kinetics and low plating/stripping overpotential. The polyimide's patternable feature energizes microbatteries in both aqueous and hydrogel electrolytes, delivering a supercapacitor-level rate performance and 400 stable cycles in the hydrogel electrolyte. Moreover, the microbattery is able to be attached to human skin and offers strong resistance to deformations, splashing, and external shock. The skin-mountable microbattery demonstrates an excellent combination of anti-corrosion, reversibility, and durability in wearables.									122	13	0	0	5	0	124			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-01-26	WOS:000607519500001	33448064

Here, we demonstrate a new class of solid-state flexible power sources that are fabricated directly on conventional A4 paper using a commercial desktop inkjet printer. A salient feature of the inkjet-printed power sources is their monolithic integration with paper, i.e., they look like inkjet-printed letters or figures that are commonly found in office documents. A supercapacitor (SC), which is composed of activated carbon/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and an ionic liquid/ultraviolet-cured triacrylate polymer-based solid-state electrolyte, is chosen as a model power source to explore the feasibility of the proposed concept. Cellulose nanofibril-mediated nanoporous mats are inkjet-printed on top of paper as a primer layer to enable high-resolution images. In addition, CNT-assisted photonic interwelded Ag nanowires are introduced onto the electrodes to further improve the electrical conductivity of the electrodes. The inkjet-printed SCs can be easily connected in series or parallel, leading to user-customized control of cell voltage and capacitance. Notably, a variety of all-inkjet-printed SCs featuring computer-designed artistic patterns/letters are aesthetically unitized with other inkjet-printed images and smart glass cups, underscoring their potential applicability as unprecedented object-tailored power sources.									313	11	0	0	17	0	317			1754-5692	1754-5706											2016-01-01	WOS:000382746300009

However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as "BDSDT" is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99% using both datasets.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

However, fabricating flexible pressure sensors with wide linear range and high sensitivity remain a great challenge. Herein, a micro-nano hybrid conductive elastomer film based on carbon materials with arched micro-patterns array on surface (P-HCF) is developed to show expected sensing properties through a sustainable route. The 1D carbon fibers (CFs) and 0D carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were incorporated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix to construct a 3D conductive network consisting of physical contact and tunneling effect among carbon materials to improve the sensing range and sensitivity. The arched micro-patterns of the P-HCF, which is designed mimicking the human fingerprints, influences the pressure distribution inside the material, giving rise to a linear sensitivity over the whole sensing range. Finite element analysis (FEA) method is investigated to simulate and analyze the compression process. The P-HCF sensor exhibits both a high sensitivity of 26.6 kPa(-1) and an exceptionally wide linear range of 20 Pa - 600 kPa. The devices were demonstrated in monitoring artery pulses, assisting in diagnosing Parkinson?s disease, and analyzing gait for healthcare. Furthermore, the sensors are integrated into complex devices to realize pressure distribution detection, controlling manipulator, and operating PC games. The attainment of excellent pressure sensing performance of the P-HCF, potentially initiates vast applications in health monitoring and human-machine interfaces.									66	0	0	0	9	0	66			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-05-06	WOS:000638221300003

The MXene nanosheets construct the anisotropic and porous skeleton, while the acidified carbon nanotubes reinforce the pore walls of MXene nanosheets, making the MCAs superelastic and compressible. The superelastic MCA with only 5 wt % of the acidified carbon nanotubes is structurally stable during cyclic compressions at both high and ultralow temperatures. Its high conductivity (447.2 S m(-1)) and ultralow density (9.1 mg cm(-3)) endow its paraffin composite with a high EMI shielding efficiency of similar to 51 dB at an ultralow filler content of 0.3 vol %. When the density of MCA increases to 18.2 mg cm(-3), its EMI shielding effectiveness reaches 90 dB. Additionally, the porous and ultralight MCAs exhibit better thermal insulation performances as compared to commercial melamine and polystyrene foams. Therefore, the superelastic, electrically conductive, lightweight, and thermally insulating MCAs would be promising for EMI shielding applications in space equipment and portable wearable devices.									77	9	0	0	6	0	77			1944-8244	1944-8252											2021-06-04	WOS:000648552500095	33877797

On the one hand, although the low entropy fossil energies are constantly transformed into high-entropy energies and consumed through various batteries, the large-scale combustion inevitably brings a huge carbon footprint and severe climate changes. On the other hand, mechanical energies are widely distributed in the urban environment in types of vibrations and rotations, and natural areas in types of water waves, rainfalls, and winds. With the development of mechanical energy harvesting technologies like triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc., various mechanical energy harvesters with optimized structures and selected materials, including triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), electromagnetic generator (EMG), etc., have been demonstrated for efficiently extracting electric power from ubiquitous existed mechanical energy sources like wind, water waves/ flows, raindrops, vibrations, human motions, organs, and so on. With a comprehensive review of energy harvesting-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications among smart environmental monitoring (wind, ocean, and agriculture), smart transportations (drivers, vehicles, ships, roads, and bridges), smart homes (windows, floors, accessories, and human-machine interfaces), smart healthcare (wearable/portable devices, and implantable devices), the concept of smart cities are being promoted to conform with requirements of carbon neutrality and environment-friendly. Moreover, by combining developed self-powered sensor nodes, self-sustainable wireless sensor nodes, and self-charging energy storage units, the concept of IoT will be reinforced by increasing 5G endpoints and accelerates digitalization in smart cities.									107	3	0	0	0	0	108			2211-2855	2211-3282											2021-10-15	WOS:000703559800002

Conventional wireless e-skins rely on rigid integrated circuit chips that compromise the overall flexibility and consume considerable power. Chip-less wireless e-skins based on inductor-capacitor resonators are limited to mechanical sensors with low sensitivities. We report a chipless wireless e-skin based on surface acoustic wave sensors made of freestanding ultrathin single-crystalline piezoelectric gallium nitride membranes. Surface acoustic wave-based e-skin offers highly sensitive, low-power, and long-term sensing of strain, ultraviolet light, and ion concentrations in sweat. We demonstrate weeklong monitoring of pulse. These results present routes to inexpensive and versatile low-power, high-sensitivity platforms for wireless health monitoring devices.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			0036-8075	1095-9203											2022-09-28	WOS:000843601300041	35981034

Conventional fall detection systems have various limitations. In this work, we first look for the correlations between different radio signal variations and activities by analyzing radio propagation model. Based on our observation, we propose WiFall, a truly unobtrusive fall detection system. WiFall employs physical layer Channel State Information (CSI) as the indicator of activities. It can detect fall of the human without hardware modification, extra environmental setup, or any wearable device. We implement WiFall on desktops equipped with commodity 802.11n NIC, and evaluate the performance in three typical indoor scenarios with several layouts of transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) links. In our area of interest, WiFall can achieve fall detection for a single person with high accuracy. As demonstrated by the experimental results, WiFall yields 90 percent detection precision with a false alarm rate of 15 percent on average using a one-class SVM classifier in all testing scenarios. It can also achieve average 94 percent fall detection precisions with 13 percent false alarm using Random Forest algorithm.									419	7	0	0	4	0	425			1536-1233	1558-0660											2017-02-01	WOS:000393808500021

However, it is still a critical challenge to optimize the structure of the designed FSC to improve energy density and realize the continuous fabrication of super-long FSCs. Herein, we propose a braided coaxial zinc-ion hybrid FSC with several meters of Ti3C2Tx MXene cathode as core electrodes, and shell zinc fiber anode was braided on the surface of the Ti3C2Tx MXene fibers across the solid electrolytes. According to the simulated results using ANSYS Maxwell software, the braided structures revealed a higher capacitance compared to the spring-like structures. The resulting FSCs exhibited a high areal capacitance of 214 mF cm(-2), the energy density of 42.8 mu Wh cm(-2) at 5 mV s(-1), and excellent cycling stability with 83.58% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The coaxial FSC was tied several kinds of knots, proving a shape-controllable fiber energy storage. Furthermore, the knitted FSC showed superior stability and weavability, which can be woven into watch belts or embedded into textiles to power smart watches and LED arrays for a few days.									34	3	0	0	1	0	34			2311-6706	2150-5551											2021-12-20	WOS:000730220300001	34907459

Here, a cracked cellulose nanofibril/silver nanowire (CA) layer-coated polyurethane (PU) sponge was acquired through a simple dip-coating process followed by precompression treatment. The electrical conductivity and mechanical property of the conductive CA@PU sponge could be effectively tuned through changing the dip-coating number. As a piezoresistive sensor, the sponge exhibited the capability of detecting both small and large motions over a wide compression strain range of 0-80%. Based on the "crack effect", the sensor possessed a detection limit as low as 0.2% and the gauge factor [GF, GF = (Delta R/R-0)/epsilon, where Delta R, R-0, and epsilon represent the instantaneous resistance change, original resistance, and strain applied, respectively] was as high as 26.07 in the strain range of 0-0.6%. Moreover, the "contact effect" enabled the sensor to be applicable for larger strain, and the GF decreased first and then became stable with increasing compression strain. In addition, frequency- and strain-dependent sensing performances were observed, demonstrating that the sensor can respond reliably to different applied frequencies and strains. Furthermore, the sensor displayed exceptional stability, repeatability, and durability over 500 cycles. Finally, the sensor could be applicable for the detection of various human bodily motions, such as phonation, stamping, knee bending, and wrist bending. Most importantly, the sponge also exhibited great potential for the fabrication of artificial electronic skin. Herein, the conductive CA@PU sponge will undoubtedly promote the development of high-performance flexible wearable electronics.									293	15	0	0	36	0	299			1944-8244	1944-8252											2019-03-20	WOS:000462260000053	30794745

Stiff and bulky pregelled electrodes are now commonly used in clinical diagnosis, causing severe discomfort to users for long-time using as well as artifact signals in motion. Here, we report a similar to 100 nm ultra-thin dry epidermal electrode that is able to conformably adhere to skin and accurately measure electrophysiological signals. It showed low sheet resistance (similar to 24 Omega/sq, 4142 S/cm), high transparency, and mechano-electrical stability. The enhanced optoelectronic performance was due to the synergistic effect between graphene and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which induced a high degree of molecular ordering on PEDOT and charge transfer on graphene by strong pi-pi interaction. Together with ultra-thin nature, this dry epidermal electrode is able to accurately monitor electrophysiological signals such as facial skin and brain activity with low-motion artifact, enabling human-machine interfacing and long-time mental/physical health monitoring.									74	9	0	0	10	0	78				2041-1723											2021-08-12	WOS:000686181800026	34385444

Herein, macromolecularly interconnected 3D graphene/nanostructured CPH is synthesized via self-assembly of CPHs and graphene oxide macrostructures. The 3D hybrid hydrogel shows uniform interconnectivity and enhanced mechanical properties due to the strong macromolecular interaction between the CPHs and graphene, thus greatly reducing aggregation in the fiber-shaping process. A proof-of-concept all-gel-state fibrous supercapacitor based on the 3D polyaniline/graphene hydrogel is fabricated to demonstrate the outstanding flexibility and mouldability, as well as superior electrochemical properties enabled by this 3D hybrid hydrogel design. The proposed device can achieve a large strain (up to approximate to 40%), and deliver a remarkable volumetric energy density of 8.80 mWh cm(-3) (at power density of 30.77 mW cm(-3)), outperforming many fiber-shaped supercapacitors reported previously.

Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing has been developed as a promising technique to print different materials on a variety of substrates with high resolution. Here, AgNW ink was developed for EHD printing. The printed features can be controlled by several parameters including AgNW concentration, ink viscosity, printing speed, stand-off distance, etc. With this method, AgNW patterns can be printed on a range of substrates, e.g. paper, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), glass, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), etc. First, AgNW samples on PDMS were characterized under bending and stretching. Then AgNW heaters and electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes were fabricated to demonstrate the potential of this printing technique for AgNW-based flexible and stretchable devices.									173	9	0	0	6	0	178			2040-3364	2040-3372											2018-12-28	WOS:000430537200003	29537024

Focusing on the relatively mature thin-film transistor technologies that are available in semiconductor fabrication plants today, the different technologies are evaluated in terms of their potential circuit applications and the implications they will have in the design of integrated circuits, from basic logic gates to more complex digital and analogue systems.

FSE aims at enabling disruptive applications such as flexible displays, wearable sensors, printed RFID tags on packaging, electronics on skin/organs, and Internet-of-things as well as possibly reducing the cost of electronic device fabrication. Thus, the key materials components of electronics, the semiconductor, the dielectric, and the conductor as well as the passive (substrate, planarization, passivation, and encapsulation layers) must exhibit electrical performance and mechanical properties compatible with FSE components and products. In this review, we summarize and analyze recent advances in materials concepts as well as in thin-film fabrication techniques for high k (or high-capacitance) gate dielectrics when integrated with FSE-compatible semiconductors such as organics, metal oxides, quantum dot arrays, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other 2D semiconductors. Since thin-film transistors (TFTs) are the key enablers of FSE devices, we discuss TFT structures and operation mechanisms after a discussion on the needs and general requirements of gate dielectrics. Also, the advantages of high-k dielectrics over low-k ones in TFT applications were elaborated. Next, after presenting the design and properties of high-k polymers and inorganic, electrolyte, and hybrid dielectric families, we focus on the most important fabrication methodologies for their deposition as TFT gate dielectric thin films. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of recent progress in performance of FSE TFTs based on these high-k dielectrics, focusing primarily on emerging semiconductor types. Finally, we conclude with an outlook and challenges section.									415	10	1	0	13	0	419			0009-2665	1520-6890											2018-06-13	WOS:000435525600009	29785854

The state-of-the-art methods usually formulate PU learning as a cost-sensitive learning problem, in which every unlabeled example is simultaneously treated as positive and negative with different class weights. However, the ground-truth label of an unlabeled example should be unique, so the existing models inadvertently introduce the label noise which may lead to the biased classifier and deteriorated performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel algorithm dubbed as "Positive and Unlabeled learning with Label Disambiguation" (PULD). We first regard all the unlabeled examples in PU learning as ambiguously labeled as positive and negative, and then employ the margin-based label disambiguation strategy, which enlarges the margin of classifier response between the most likely label and the less likely one, to find the unique ground-truth label of each unlabeled example. Theoretically, we derive the generalization error bound of the proposed method by analyzing its Rademacher complexity. Experimentally, we conduct intensive experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, and the results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PULD to the existing PU learning approaches.					28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	AUG 10-16, 2019AUG 10-16, 2019	Int Joint Conf Artifical IntelligenceInt Joint Conf Artifical Intelligence	Macao, PEOPLES R CHINAMacao, PEOPLES R CHINA	143	10	0	0	10	0	155					978-0-9992411-4-1										2019-01-01	WOS:000761735104056

Data collected in these ecologically valid, patient-relevant settings can overcome limitations of conventional clinical assessments, as they capture fluctuating and rare events. These data could support clinical decision making and could also serve as outcomes in clinical trials. However, studies that directly compared assessments made in unsupervised and supervised (eg, in the laboratory or hospital) settings point to large disparities, even in the same parameters of mobility. These differences appear to be affected by psychological, physiological, cognitive, environmental, and technical factors, and by the types of mobilities and diagnoses assessed. To facilitate the successful adaptation of the unsupervised assessment of mobility into clinical practice and clinical trials, clinicians and researchers should consider these disparities and the multiple factors that contribute to them.									107	0	0	0	28	0	107			1474-4422	1474-4465											2020-05-01	WOS:000573045100020	32059811

After introducing the principles of planar optics and discussing earlier works on sub-wavelength diffractive optics, we introduce a classification of metasurfaces based on their different phase mechanisms and profiles and a comparison between plasmonic and dielectric metasurfaces. We place particular emphasis on the recent developments on electric and magnetic field control of light with dielectric nanostructures and highlight the physical mechanisms and designs required for efficient all-dielectric metasurfaces. Practical devices of general interest such as metalenses, beam deflectors, holograms, and polarizing interfaces are discussed, including high-performance metalenses at visible wavelengths. Successful strategies to achieve achromatic response at selected wavelengths and near unity transmission/reflection efficiency are discussed. Dielectric metasurfaces and dispersion management at interfaces open up technology opportunities for applications including wavefront control, lightweight imaging systems, displays, electronic consumer products, and conformable and wearable optics.

Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model.

In this study, we develop a facile method for fabricating 3D self-supporting Ti3C2 with MoS2 and Cu2O nanocrystal composites for supercapacitor applications. MoS2 was incorporated in Ti3C2 using a hydrothermal method, and Cu2O was embedded in two-dimensional nanosheets by in situ chemical reduction. The resulting composite electrode showed a synergistic effect between the components. Ti3C2 served as a conductive additive to connect MoS2 nanosheets and facilitate charge transfer. MoS2 acted as an active spacer to increase the interlayer space of Ti3C2 and protect Ti3C2 from oxidation. Cu2O effectively prevented the collapse of the lamellar structure of Ti3C2-MoS2. Consequently, the optimized composite exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 1459 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Further, by assembling an all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor with activated carbon, a high energy density of 60.5 W h kg(-1) was achieved at a power density of 10(3) W kg(-1). Additionally, the supercapacitor exhibited a capacitance retention of 90% during 3000 charging-discharging cycles. Moreover, high mechanical robustness was retained after bending at different angles, thereby suggesting significant potential applications for future flexible and wearable devices.									69	1	0	0	0	0	70			1944-8244	1944-8252											2021-06-16	WOS:000655027500056	33950668

Although the manufacture of stretchable self-charging power units has been demonstrated by integrating stretchable energy harvesters and power management circuits with energy storage units, they often suffer from low and unstable output power especially under mechanical deformation and human movements, as well as complex and expensive fabrication processes. This work presents a low-cost, scalable, and facile manufacturing approach based on laser-induced graphene foams to yield a self-powered wireless sensing platform. 3D porous foams with high specific surface area and excellent charge transport provide an efficient flow of triboelectric electrons in triboelectric nanogenerators. The surface coating or doping with second laser irradiation on these foams can also form a 3D composite to provide high energy density in micro-supercapacitor arrays. The integration of a triboelectric nanogenerator and power management circuits with micro-supercapacitor arrays can efficiently harvest intermittent mechanical energy from body movements into stable power output. 3D foams and their composites patterned into various geometries conveniently create various deformable sensors on large scale at low cost. The generated stable, yet high, power with adjustable voltage and current outputs drives various stretchable sensors and wireless transmission modules to wirelessly measure pulse, strain, temperature, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and blood oxygen. The self-powered, wireless, wearable sensing platform paves the way to wirelessly detect clinically relevant biophysical and biochemical signals for early disease diagnostics and healthy aging.									52	0	0	0	1	0	52			1931-9401												2022-02-10	WOS:000749876500001

The over-spraying of pesticides onto crops has escalated pesticide contamination of food products and water bodies, as well as disturbing ecological and environmental systems. In this regard, developing simple, low-cost, and rapid-sensing strategies and portable devices for the precise, efficient, rapid, and on-site detection of pesticide residues in agricultural fields is indeed necessary and urgently required for the wellbeing and safety of mankind and other species.Scope and approach: In this review, we make a comprehensive study of the up-to-date state-of-the-art research progress on the on-site sensing strategies and portable devices for the detection of pesticide residues in agricultural foods using paper-, liquid-, and gel-based optical-sensing techniques. Moreover, we delineate the detailed on-site detection mechanism and sensing behavior of the aforementioned strategies and discuss the challenges and future perspectives associated with the development of optical techniques.Key findings and conclusions: Recent scientific and technological studies based on optical sensing strategies such as fluorescence sensors, target-responsive hydrogels, chemiluminescence assay, tube enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, enzymatic fiber-optic biosensor, phosphorescence, lateral flow immunoassay, double-signal fluorescence strategy, wearable glove-based sensors, and paper-based sensors have made novel advancements and brought scientific insight for the on-site detection of pesticide residues in agricultural foods. This review provides significant insights and future perspectives that might serve as the basis for the design and development of novel optical sensors with applicability in various fields.									52	2	0	0	17	0	54			0924-2244	1879-3053											2022-05-12	WOS:000789653500007

Methods: An adaptive implementation of 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is inherently used to fuse the two major blocks of the ECG classification into a single learning body: feature extraction and classification. Therefore, for each patient, an individual and simple CNN will be trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and thus, such patient-specific feature extraction ability can further improve the classification performance. Since this also negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted manual features, once a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner or alternatively, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time ECG monitoring and early alert system on a light-weight wearable device. Results: The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a superior classification performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusion: Besides the speed and computational efficiency achieved, once a dedicated CNN is trained for an individual patient, it can solely be used to classify his/her long ECG records such as Holter registers in a fast and accurate manner. Significance: Due to its simple and parameter invariant nature, the proposed system is highly generic, and, thus, applicable to any ECG dataset.									923	40	2	0	141	1	981			0018-9294	1558-2531											2016-03-01	WOS:000371933800022	26285054

The general glove solutions, which are employed to detect motions of our dexterous hands, only achieve recognizing discrete single gestures (i.e., numbers, letters, or words) instead of sentences, far from satisfying the meet of the signers' daily communication. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence enabled sign language recognition and communication system comprising sensing gloves, deep learning block, and virtual reality interface. Non-segmentation and segmentation assisted deep learning model achieves the recognition of 50 words and 20 sentences. Significantly, the segmentation approach splits entire sentence signals into word units. Then the deep learning model recognizes all word elements and reversely reconstructs and recognizes sentences. Furthermore, new/never-seen sentences created by new-order word elements recombination can be recognized with an average correct rate of 86.67%. Finally, the sign language recognition results are projected into virtual space and translated into text and audio, allowing the remote and bidirectional communication between signers and non-signers.Though wearable gloves are widely used for gesture associated applications (e.g. sign language recognition), sentence identification of sign language remains a challenge. Here, the authors report AI-enabled recognition system helps barrier-free communication between signers and non-signers.									104	6	0	0	6	0	107				2041-1723											2021-09-23	WOS:000695492800023	34508076

This paper presents a lightweight and low cost wireless inertial motion capture system for the simultaneous reconstruction of human body attitude and displacement. First of all, the device is based on human sensor networks and distributes 15 sensor nodes on the key human limbs. Then, after an initial sensor alignment with the reduced error, a zero-speed update algorithm is used to calculate foot displacement. In addition, to constantly update the human posture information, a kind of motion reconstruction method based on the gradient descent method was used to fuse the sensor data. Finally, a new method of three-dimensional human body reconstruction is proposed, which is different from the traditional motion capture system. Through unconstrained traversal of the root, the human posture and foot trajectory are combined to realize the synchronous reconstruction of posture and displacement. It is concluded from the experiment results that the estimation errors are well controlled, and motion patterns are consistent with the actual situation.									66	0	0	0	16	0	66			0884-8173	1098-111X											2021-09-27	WOS:000700172300001

Wood is the most abundant renewable resource and offers green and sustainable raw materials for fabricating lightweight carbon materials. Herein, a facile and sustainable strategy is proposed to fabricate a wood-derived elastic carbon aerogel with tracheid-like texture from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and lignin. The flexible CNFs entangle and assemble into an interconnected framework, while lignin with high thermal stability and favorable stiffness prevents the framework from severe structural shrinkage during annealing. This strategy leads to an ordered tracheid-like structure and significantly reduces the thermal deformation of the CNFs network, producing a lightweight and elastic carbon aerogel. The wood-derived carbon aerogel exhibits excellent mechanical performance, including high compressibility (up to 95% strain) and fatigue resistance. It also reveals high sensitivity at a wide working pressure range of 0-16.89 kPa and can detect human biosignals accurately. Moreover, the carbon aerogel can be assembled into a flexible and free-standing all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor that reveals satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility. These features make the wood-derived carbon aerogel highly attractive for pressure sensor and flexible electrode applications.									138	9	0	0	26	0	143			1616-301X	1616-3028											2020-03-01	WOS:000517137400001

However, limited EMI shielding materials are successfully used in practical applications, due to the heavy thickness and absence of sufficient strength or flexibility. Herein, an ultrathin and flexible carbon nanotubes/MXene/cellulose nanofibrils composite paper with gradient and sandwich structure is constructed for EMI shielding application via a facile alternating vacuum-assisted filtration process. The composite paper exhibits outstanding mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 97.9 +/- 5.0 MPa and a fracture strain of 4.6 +/- 0.2%. Particularly, the paper shows a high electrical conductivity of 2506.6 S m(-1) and EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 38.4 dB due to the sandwich structure in improving EMI SE, and the gradient structure on regulating the contributions from reflection and absorption. This strategy is of great significance in fabricating ultrathin and flexible composite paper for highly efficient EMI shielding performance and in broadening the practical applications of MXene-based composite materials.									223	32	0	0	16	0	225			2311-6706	2150-5551											2019-09-19	WOS:000484940600001	34138029

Because of these distinctive advantages, MXenes are considered as very competitive pressure-sensitive materials in applications of flexible piezoresistive sensors. This work reviews the preparation methods, basic properties, and assembly methods of MXenes and their recent developments in piezoresistive sensor applications. The recent developments of MXene-based flexible piezoresistive sensors can be categorized into one-dimensional fibrous, two-dimensional planar, and three-dimensional sensors according to their various structures. The trends of multifunctional integration of MXene-based pressure sensors are also summarized. Finally, we end this review by describing the opportunities and challenges for MXene-based pressure sensors and the great prospects of MXenes in the field of pressure sensor applications.									54	2	0	0	8	0	54			1936-0851	1936-086X											2022-04-22	WOS:000776691400004	35148056

Recently, hydrogels have been intensively studied to develop stretchable electronics for wearables and soft robots. However, regular hydrogels are inevitably frozen at the subzero temperature and easily dehydrated, and have weak surface adhesion. Herein, a novel hydrogel-based ionic skin (iSkin) capable of strain sensing is demonstrated with high toughness, high stretchability, excellent ambient stability, superior anti-freezing capability, and strong surface adhesion. The iSkin consists of a piece of ionically and covalently cross-linked tough hydrogel with a thin bioadhesive layer. With the addition of biocompatible cryoprotectant and electrolyte, the iSkin shows good conductivity in wide ranges of relative humidity (15-90%) and temperature (-95-25 degrees C). In addition, the iSkin can adhere firmly to diverse material surfaces under different conditions, including cloth fabric, skin, and elastomers, in both dry and wet conditions, at subzero temperature, and/or with dynamic movement. The iSkin is demonstrated for applications including strain sensing on both human body and winter coat, human-machine interaction, motion/deformation sensing on a soft gripper and a soft robot at extremely cold conditions. This work provides a new paradigm for developing high-performance artificial skins for wearable sensing and soft robotics.									83	2	0	0	9	0	84			1616-301X	1616-3028											2021-07-28	WOS:000678187300001

However, these methods rely heavily on manual feature extraction, which may hinder the generalization model performance. With the increasing popularity and success of deep learning methods, using these techniques to recognize human actions in mobile and wearable computing scenarios has attracted widespread attention. In this paper, a deep neural network that combines convolutional layers with long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed. This model could extract activity features automatically and classify them with a few model parameters. LSTM is a variant of the recurrent neural network (RNN), which is more suitable for processing temporal sequences. In the proposed architecture, the raw data collected by mobile sensors was fed into a two-layer LSTM followed by convolutional layers. In addition, a global average pooling layer (GAP) was applied to replace the fully connected layer after convolution for reducing model parameters. Moreover, a batch normalization layer (BN) was added after the GAP layer to speed up the convergence, and obvious results were achieved. The model performance was evaluated on three public datasets (UCI, WISDM, and OPPORTUNITY). Finally, the overall accuracy of the model in the UCI-HAR dataset is 95.78 & x0025;, in the WISDM dataset is 95.85 & x0025;, and in the OPPORTUNITY dataset is 92.63 & x0025;. The results show that the proposed model has higher robustness and better activity detection capability than some of the reported results. It can not only adaptively extract activity features, but also has fewer parameters and higher accuracy.									181	4	0	0	7	0	185			2169-3536												2020-05-18	WOS:000527411700086

Based on the electrochemical behavior of Zn2+ in the charging and discharging process, herein we review the research progress on anode materials for use in aqueous ZIBs based on two aspects: Zn deposition and Zn2+ intercalation. To date, Zn dendrite, corrosion, and passivation issues have restricted the development of aqueous ZIBs. However, many strategies have been developed, including structural design, interface protection of the Zn anode, Zn alloying, and using polymer electrolytes. The main aim is to stabilize the Zn stripping/plating layer and limit side reactions. Zn2+-intercalated anodes, with a high Zn2+ storage capacity to replace the current metal Zn anode, are also a potential option. Finally, some suggestions have been put forward for the subsequent optimization strategy, which are expected to promote further development of aqueous ZIBs.									216	15	0	0	6	0	218			1936-0851	1936-086X											2021-01-19	WOS:000603308800010	33314908

Given these concerns, developing solid-state batteries is one of the most promising routes to achieve this aspiration. Because of the excellent flexibility and process ability, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based electrolytes possess great potential to pack high energy density flexible batteries, however, suffers the various intrinsic shortcomings such as inferior ionic conductivity, a high degree of crystallinity, and lack of reactive groups. Clearing the progress of the present state and concluding the specific challenges faced by PVDF based electrolytes will help to develop PVDF based polymer batteries. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of gel polymer electrolytes and all solid polymer electrolytes based on PVDF. The ion transport mechanisms and preparation methods of PVDF based electrolytes are briefly introduced. Meanwhile, the current design principle and properties of electrolytes are highlighted and systematically discussed. Some peculiar modified strategies performed in lithium-sulfur batteries and lithium-oxygen batteries are also included. Finally, this review describes the challenges and prospects of some solid-state electrolytes to provide strategies for manufacturing high-performance PVDF electrolytes aimed at practical application with flexible requirements.

In the case of myopia, evidence for a large number of risk factors has been presented, but they have not been systematically tested for confounding. To be useful for designing preventive interventions, risk factor analysis ideally needs to be carried through to demonstration of a causal connection, with a defined mechanism. Statistical analysis is often complicated by covariation of variables, and demonstration of a causal relationship between a factor and myopia using Mendelian randomization or in a randomized clinical trial should be aimed for. When strict analysis of this kind is applied, associations between various measures of educational pressure and myopia are consistently observed. However, associations between more nearwork and more myopia are generally weak and inconsistent, but have been supported by meta-analysis. Associations between time outdoors and less myopia are stronger and more consistently observed, including by meta-analysis. Measurement of nearwork and time outdoors has traditionally been performed with questionnaires, but is increasingly being pursued with wearable objective devices. A causal link between increased years of education and more myopia has been confirmed by Mendelian randomization, whereas the protective effect of increased time outdoors from the development of myopia has been confirmed in randomized clinical trials. Other proposed risk factors need to be tested to see if they modulate these variables. The evidence linking increased screen time to myopia is weak and inconsistent, although limitations on screen time are increasingly under consideration as interventions to control the epidemic of myopia.									60	7	0	0	15	0	67			0146-0404	1552-5783											2021-08-26	WOS:000685195500003	33909035

However, to fully mimic the functionality of human skin, a capacitive strain sensor should be stretchable and self-healable. The development of such a sensor is limited by electrode materials which generally lack self-healability and/or stretchability. A highly stretchable and self-healing MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel electrode is developed for use in capacitive strain sensors for E-skin. The incorporation of MXene into the PVA enhances the conductivity and self-healability of the hydrogel. The electrode exhibits high stretchability at break (approximate to 1200%) and instantaneous self healing (healing time approximate to 0.15 s). A capacitive sensor based on these electrodes shows high linearity, up to 200%, low hysteresis, a sensitivity of approximate to 0.40, and good mechanical durability (a 5.8% reduction in relative capacitance change after 10 000 cycles). Moreover, this sensor maintains its performance after a self-healing test, proving its potential for the monitoring of human motion.									217	11	0	0	18	0	221			2199-160X												2019-08-13	WOS:000477987400020

However, obtaining accurate, continuous estimates of these parameters with high temporal resolution remains challenging. Here, we report a platform that can wirelessly measure sweat rate, sweat loss and skin temperature in real time. The approach combines a short, straight fluid passage to capture sweat as it emerges from the skin with a flow sensor that is based on a thermal actuator and precision thermistors, and that is physically isolated from, but thermally coupled to, the sweat. The platform transfers data autonomously using a Bluetooth Low Energy system on a chip. Our approach can also be integrated with advanced microfluidic systems and colorimetric chemical reagents for the measurement of pH and the concentration of chloride, creatinine and glucose in sweat.A wearable platform, which uses a thermal sensing module isolated from biofluids and a Bluetooth Low Energy system on a chip for wireless data transfer, can be used to continuously monitor sweat.									62	2	0	0	11	0	62			2520-1131												2021-03-29	WOS:000634634500001

For example, a smart contact lens, which is capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid, could provide real-time, noninvasive medical diagnostics. However, previous reports concerning the smart contact lens have indicated that opaque and brittle components have been used to enable the operation of the electronic device, and this could block the user's vision and potentially damage the eye. In addition, the use of expensive and bulky equipment to measure signals from the contact lens sensors could interfere with the user's external activities. Thus, we report an unconventional approach for the fabrication of a soft, smart contact lens in which glucose sensors, wireless power transfer circuits, and display pixels to visualize sensing signals in real time are fully integrated using transparent and stretchable nanostructures. The integration of this display into the smart lens eliminates the need for additional, bulky measurement equipment. This soft, smart contact lens can be transparent, providing a clear view by matching the refractive indices of its locally patterned areas. The resulting soft, smart contact lens provides real-time, wireless operation, and there are in vivo tests to monitor the glucose concentration in tears (suitable for determining the fasting glucose level in the tears of diabetic patients) and, simultaneously, to provide sensing results through the contact lens display.									366	13	0	0	63	0	370			2375-2548												2018-01-01	WOS:000426694200067	29387797

Among them, flexible electrochemical capacitors (ECs) have been considered as one of the most promising candidates because of their significant advantages in power and energy densities, and unique properties of being flexible, lightweight, low-cost, and environmentally friendly compared with current energy storage devices. In a common EC, carbon materials play an irreplaceable and principal role in its energy-storage performance. Up till now, most progress towards flexible ECs technologies has mostly benefited from the continuous development of carbon materials. As a result, in view of the dual remarkable highlights of ECs and carbon materials, a summary of recent research progress on carbon-based flexible EC electrode materials is presented in this review, including carbon fiber (CF, consisting of carbon microfiber-CMF and carbon nanofiber-CNF) networks, carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene coatings, CNT and/or graphene papers (or films), and freestanding three-dimensional (3D) flexible carbon-based macroscopic architectures.

Advances in robotic hardware and energy supplies have enabled viable prototypes for human testing. This review paper describes current lower limb robotic exoskeletons, with specific regard to common trends in the field. The preponderance of published literature lacks rigorous quantitative evaluations of exoskeleton performance, making it difficult to determine the disadvantages and drawbacks of many of the devices. We analyzed common approaches in exoskeleton design and the convergence, or lack thereof, with certain technologies. We focused on actuators, sensors, energy sources, materials, and control strategies. One of the largest hurdles to be overcome in exoskeleton research is the user interface and control. More intuitive and flexible user interfaces are needed to increase the success of robotic exoskeletons.

Herein, a novel strategy is introduced to boost the energy density of flexible soild-state supercapacitors via rational design of hierarchically graphene nano-composite (GNC) electrode material and employing an ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte. The hierarchical graphene nanocomposite consisting of graphene and polyaniline-derived carbon is synthesized as an electrode material via a scalable process. The meso/microporous graphene nanocomposites exhibit a high specific capacitance of 176 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g-(1) in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3- methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) with a wide voltage window of 3.5 V, good rate capability of 80.7% in the range of 0.5-10 A g(-1) and excellent stability over 10 000 cycles, which is attributed to the superior conductivity (7246 S m(-1)), and quite large specific surface area (2416 m(2) g(-1)) as well as hierarchical meso/micropores distribution of the electrode materials. Furthermore, flexible solid-state supercapacitor devices based on the GNC electrodes and gel polymer electrolyte film are assembled, which offer high specific capacitance of 180 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), large energy density of 75 Wh Kg(-1), and remarkable flexible performance under consecutive bending conditions.									223	21	0	0	11	0	225			1616-301X	1616-3028											2018-01-24	WOS:000422930400006

However, it remains challenging to enhance their mechanical properties without compromising the electrical properties of high-performance active materials. Here, we develop a series of novel polymer donors (P(D)s), with which highly efficient PSCs having remarkable mechanical reliability are demonstrated. By interposing a controlled amount of 1,10-di(thiophen-2-yl)decane flexible spacer (FS) into a PM6 backbone, we are able to significantly enhance the intermixing of the new P(D)s with a small molecule acceptor (Y7), affording sufficient pathways for efficient charge percolation and mechanical stress dissipation. As a result, PSCs based on the P-D containing 5 mol% FS units and Y7 exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17% with a crack onset strain (COS) of 12% and a cohesive fracture energy (G(c)) of 2.1 J m(-2), significantly outperforming reference PM6-based devices (PCE = 15%, COS = 2% and G(c) = 1.0 J m(-2)). Both the photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness of these PSCs are among the best values reported to date. The rational design of the P(D)s demonstrated here presents a highly promising strategy to address the mechanical properties of SMA-based solar cells and their viable application in flexible/stretchable electronics.									69	3	0	0	1	0	70			1754-5692	1754-5706											2021-06-14	WOS:000658827600001

Freestanding/flexible electrodes hold enormous potential for use in wearable electronic devices. Carbon-yielding polymers and the optimal use of sacrificial polymers, metal oxides, and sulfides retain the flexibility and enhance the surface area and pseudocapacitance of electrodes. Both as-prepared electrospun fibers and carbonized nanofibers are compatible with surface decoration via various chemical and electrochemical routes. Metal oxides/sulfides with various morphologies, such as nanocones and nanosheets, can be grown on the carbon nanofibers or on the as-prepared electrospun fibers using chemical synthesis methods such as electro-deposition, hydrothermal processes, and chemical impregnation to enhance the pseudocapacitance of the electrodes. Similarly, the deposition of metal organic frameworks on as-prepared electrospun fibers embellishes these fibers with nanostructures of specific morphologies such as dodecahedral and spindle-shaped structures. Under optimal conditions, these morphologies do not hamper the flexibility of the fibers, and binders are not required to retain them or maintain the electrode integrity. The engineering of electrodes with various morphologies and process parameters is presented systematically. Electrospinning-derived electrodes that have demonstrated significant electrochemical performance are highlighted and critically analyzed, and the energy storage mechanisms of these supercapacitors are described in detail.

Older adults and those with low socioeconomic status are especially at risk for poor health, largely due to their sedentary lifestyles. Fitness technology, including trackers and smartphone applications (apps), has become increasingly popular for measuring and encouraging physical activity in recent years. However, many questions remain regarding the effectiveness of this technology for promoting behavior change. Behavior change techniques such as goal setting, feedback, rewards, and social factors are often included in fitness technology. However, it is not clear which components are most effective and which are actually being used by consumers. We discuss additional strategies not typically included in fitness technology devices or apps that are promising for engaging inactive, vulnerable populations. These include action planning, restructuring negative attitudes, enhancing environmental conditions, and identifying other barriers to regular physical activity. We consider which strategies are most conducive to motivating behavior change among sedentary adults. Overall, fitness technology has the potential to significantly impact public health, research, and policies. We suggest ways in which app developers and behavior change experts can collaborate to develop successful apps. Advances are still needed to help inactive individuals determine how, when, where, and with whom they can increase their physical activity.									213	2	1	0	18	3	216				2296-2565											2017-01-11	WOS:000408409200001	28123997

A critical bottleneck for temporal and regional sweat analysis is achieving uniform, high-throughput fabrication of sweat sensor components, including microfluidic chip and sensing electrodes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce microfluidic sensing patches mass fabricated via roll-to-roll (R2R) processes. The patch allows sweat capture within a spiral microfluidic for real-time measurement of sweat parameters including [Na+], [K+], [glucose], and sweat rate in exercise and chemically induced sweat. The patch is demonstrated for investigating regional sweat composition, predicting whole-body fluid/electrolyte loss during exercise, uncovering relationships between sweat metrics, and tracking glucose dynamics to explore sweat-to-blood correlations in healthy and diabetic individuals. By enabling a comprehensive sweat analysis, the presented device is a crucial tool for advancing sweat testing beyond the research stage for point-of-care medical and athletic applications.									177	10	0	0	44	0	178			2375-2548												2019-09-04	WOS:000481798400045	31453333	
J	Puntoni, Stefano; Reczek, Rebecca Walker; Giesler, Markus; Botti, Simona								Consumers and Artificial Intelligence: An Experiential Perspective								JOURNAL OF MARKETING				85	1	SI		131	151				10.1177/0022242920953847							Article	JAN 2021	2021	Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations' investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.									140	2	0	0	0	0	142			0022-2429	1547-7185											2021-01-12	WOS:000599813900014

Currently, self-powered high-performance gas sensors have aroused great interests. In this work, MXene/Co3O4 composite-based formaldehyde (HCHO) sensor working at room temperature (RT) driven by ZnO/MXene nanowire (NW) arrays piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) was reported. A series of characterizations were performed to verify the synthesis of the sensing materials. With HCHO concentration increasing from 0.01 ppm to 10 ppm, the MXene/Co3O4 composite sensor showed obvious response. The piezoelectric output voltage based on ZnO/MXene NW arrays showed great self-powered ability to drive the MXene/Co3O4 composite sensor. The humidity influence and the flexibility of the gas sensor were investigated for potential application. In addition, the flexible PENG can be used to collect human motion energy as wearable devices. The possible gas sensing mechanism was attributed to the synergistic interfacial interactions between MXene and Co3O4.									69	4	0	0	2	0	70				0925-4005											2021-05-19	WOS:000644708000002

Here, we develop a one-step post-treatment to improve the power factor of PEDOT:PSS films by using a water-based solution, which is composed of co-solvent (polar solvent dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and deionized water) and organic reducing agent L-ascorbic acid (LAA). The 80 vol.% DMAC solution significantly boosts the room-temperature electrical conductivity of the films from 5 to 964 S cm(-1), while the Seebeck coefficient can be further enhanced from 18.7 to 25 mu V K-1 by treating with 0.5 mol L-1 LAA, contributing to a significantly improved power factor of 55.3 mu W m(-1) K-2. The boosted electrical conductivity is ascribed to the separated PEDOT and PSS phases triggered by the high dielectric constant and polarity of DMAC; while the improved Seebeck coefficient is attributed to the reduced oxidation degree of PEDOT from the reducing agent LAA, both confirmed by the comprehensive structural and morphological characterizations. Furthermore, a maximum power factor of 64.4 mu W m(-1) K-2 can be achieved at 360 K and the observed temperature-dependent electrical transport behavior can be well explained by the Mott variable range hopping model. Besides, a flexible thermoelectric device, assembled by the as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS films, exhibits a maximum output power of similar to 23 nW at a temperature difference of 25 K, indicating the potential for applying to low-grade wearable electronics.

Wearable devices enables gait to be measured in naturalistic environments, however questions remain regarding validity. Previous research suggests that when compared with a laboratory reference, measurement accuracy is acceptable for mean but not variability or asymmetry gait characteristics. Some fundamental reasons for this have been presented, (e.g., synchronization, different sampling frequencies) but to date this has not been systematically examined. The aims of this study were to: 1) quantify a comprehensive range of gait characteristics measured using a single triaxial accelerometer-based monitor; 2) examine outcomes and monitor performance in measuring gait in older adults and those with Parkinson's disease (PD); and 3) carry out a detailed comparison with those derived from an instrumented walkway to account for any discrepancies. Fourteen gait characteristics were quantified in 30 people with incident PD and 30 healthy age-matched controls. Of the 14 gait characteristics compared, agreement between instruments was excellent for four (ICCs 0.913-0.983); moderate for four (ICCs 0.508-0.766); and poor for six characteristics (ICCs 0.637-0.370). Further analysis revealed that differences reflect an increased sensitivity of accelerometry to detect motion, rather thanmeasurement error. This is most likely because accelerometry measures gait as a continuous activity rather than discrete footfall events, per instrumented tools. The increased sensitivity shown for these characteristics will be of particular interest to researchers keen to interpret " real-world" gait data. In conclusion, use of a body-worn monitor is recommended for the measurement of gait but is likely to yield more sensitive data for asymmetry and variability features.									191	2	0	0	45	0	195			2168-2194												2016-05-01	WOS:000376283900012	25850097

Unfortunately, the bottleneck factors in electrolytes that largely limit the working life and energy efficiency of ZABs have long been relatively neglected. Herein, an alkaline gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is fabricated through multiple crosslinking reactions among poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(acrylic acid), and graphene oxide followed by intense uptake of an alkali and the KI reaction modifier. The prepared GPE exhibits essentially improved properties compared to traditional PVA gel electrolyte in terms of mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capability. In addition, the introduced reaction modifier I- in the GPE changes the path of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction, leading to a more thermodynamically favorable path. The optimized GPE enables flexible ZABs exhibiting an exceptionally low charge potential of 1.69 V, a long cycling time of 200 h, a high energy efficiency of 73%, and rugged reliability under different extreme working conditions. Moreover, the successful integration of ZABs in a variety of real wearable electronic devices demonstrates their excellent practicability as flexible power sources.									153	9	0	0	8	0	154			0935-9648	1521-4095											2020-04-28	WOS:000526173700001	32301217

There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus (< 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials & fabrication methods are described in this review article. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.									279	11	0	0	11	0	288			1598-6446	2005-4092											2017-02-01	WOS:000393707600002

In this study, "green" electrically conductive Ag nanowire (AgNW)/cellulose nanofiber (CNF) hybrid nanopaper was fabricated to prepare flexible sensors using the facial solution blending and vacuum filtration technique. The amphiphilic property of cellulose is beneficial for the homogeneous dispersion of AgNW to construct effective electrically conductive networks. Two different types of strain sensors were designed to study their applications in strain sensing. One was the tensile strain sensor where the hybrid nanopaper was sandwiched between two thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) films through hot compression, and special micro-crack structure was constructed through the pre-strain process to enhance the sensitivity. Interestingly, typical pre-strain dependent strain sensing behavior was observed due to different crack densities constructed under different pre-strains. As a result, it exhibited an ultralow detection limit as low as 0.2%, good reproducibility under different strains and excellent stability and durability during 500 cycles (1% strain, 0.5 mm/min). The other was the bending strain sensor where the hybrid nanopaper was adhered onto TPU film, showing stable and recoverable linearly sensing behavior towards two different bending modes (tension and compression). Importantly, the bending sensor displayed great potential for human motion and physiological signal detection. Furthermore, the hybrid nanopaper also exhibited stable and reproducible negative temperature sensing behavior when it was served as a temperature sensor. This study provides a guideline for fabricating flexible and biodegradable sensors. (C) 2020 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

In this paper, inspired by a "brick-mortar" sandwich structure, phase change capsules (PCCs) and MXene nanosheets are prepared. Subsequently, a one-step vacuum-assisted filtration method is used to fabricate a multifunctional flexible PCC/MXene/polyvinyl alcohol (PMP) phase change composite film with high light-to-thermal conversion efficiency, Joule heating generation, fire safety, and EMI shielding effects. The superior preparation technology endows the film with multi-source driven thermal management capabilities and excellent EMI shielding effectiveness values (43.13 dB). In addition, the PMP film exhibits good flexibility and high enthalpy (136.8 J g(-1)). Surprisingly, the PMP film's excellent fire safety properties improve its reliability and safety. In summary, the simple preparation technique and outstanding overall performance of the PMP films provide broad application prospects in advanced thermal management and EMI shielding in wearable products.									82	6	0	0	3	0	83			1616-301X	1616-3028											2022-04-06	WOS:000774541300001

In this work, PENGs are fabricated by using electrospun nanocomposite fiber mats comprising barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles, graphene nanosheets and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). When the nanocomposite fiber mats are composed of 0.15 wt% graphene nanosheets and 15 wt% BT nanoparticles, the open-circuit voltage and electric power of the PENG can reach as high as 11 V and 4.1 mu W under a loading frequency of 2 Hz and a strain of 4 mm, and no apparent decline of the open-circuit voltage is observed after 1800 cycles in the durability test. In addition, the PENG generate a peak voltage as high as 112 V during a finger pressing-releasing process, which can light up 15 LEDs and drive an electric watch. The improved output of the PENG is ascribed to the synergistic contribution of the BT nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets to the piezoelectric performance enhancement of the nanocomposite fibers. This study shows that the nanocomposite fiber based flexible PENGs are promising mechanical energy harvesters and effective power sources for portable electronic and wearable devices.									241	12	0	0	10	0	244			2211-2855	2211-3282											2018-12-28	WOS:000444859700017

Patterns suggesting atrial fibrillation were detected in 2161 participants who then received ECG monitoring devices to be worn for 7 days to confirm the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation.Background Optical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses. The ability of a smartwatch application (app) to identify atrial fibrillation during typical use is unknown. Methods Participants without atrial fibrillation (as reported by the participants themselves) used a smartphone (Apple iPhone) app to consent to monitoring. If a smartwatch-based irregular pulse notification algorithm identified possible atrial fibrillation, a telemedicine visit was initiated and an electrocardiography (ECG) patch was mailed to the participant, to be worn for up to 7 days. Surveys were administered 90 days after notification of the irregular pulse and at the end of the study. The main objectives were to estimate the proportion of notified participants with atrial fibrillation shown on an ECG patch and the positive predictive value of irregular pulse intervals with a targeted confidence interval width of 0.10. Results We recruited 419,297 participants over 8 months. Over a median of 117 days of monitoring, 2161 participants (0.52%) received notifications of irregular pulse. Among the 450 participants who returned ECG patches containing data that could be analyzed - which had been applied, on average, 13 days after notification - atrial fibrillation was present in 34% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 39) overall and in 35% (97.5% CI, 27 to 43) of participants 65 years of age or older. Among participants who were notified of an irregular pulse, the positive predictive value was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.92) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular pulse notification and 0.71 (97.5% CI, 0.69 to 0.74) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular tachogram. Of 1376 notified participants who returned a 90-day survey, 57% contacted health care providers outside the study. There were no reports of serious app-related adverse events. Conclusions The probability of receiving an irregular pulse notification was low. Among participants who received notification of an irregular pulse, 34% had atrial fibrillation on subsequent ECG patch readings and 84% of notifications were concordant with atrial fibrillation. This siteless (no on-site visits were required for the participants), pragmatic study design provides a foundation for large-scale pragmatic studies in which outcomes or adherence can be reliably assessed with user-owned devices.

In particular, the ultrathin Co3O4 layers have a maximum contact area on the conductive support, facilitating the rapid electron transport and preventing the aggregation of ultrathin layers. The ultrathin feature of Co3O4 layers is characterized by the transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectra, and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Benefiting from the high utilization degree of active materials and rapid charge transport, the mass activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions of the ultrathin Co3O4/CC electrode is more than 10 times higher than that of the carbon cloth loaded with commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles. Compared to the commercial Co3O4/CC electrode, the flexible Zn-air battery using ultrathin Co3O4/CC electrode exhibits excellent rechargeable performance and high mechanical stability. Furthermore, the flexible Zn-air battery is integrated with a flexible display unit. The whole integrated device can operate without obvious performance degradation under serious deformation and even during the cutting process, which makes it highly promising for wearable and roll-up optoelectronics.									298	20	0	0	8	0	302			1614-6832	1614-6840											2017-09-20	WOS:000411182500005

Herein, we report a scalable synthesis technology of mixed-valence manganese oxide nanoparticles anchored to reduced graphene oxide (rGO/MnOx) as the high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. First, 2-dimensional (2D) d-MnO2 nanosheets are formed on a graphene oxide (GO) template, which is then in situ reduced by hydrazine vapour to mixed-valence manganese oxide nanoparticles evenly distributed on a rGO conductive network. The obtained rGO/MnOx electrode material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 202 F g(-1) (mass loading of 2 mg cm(-2)), a large areal specific capacitance of 2.5 F cm(-2) (mass loading of up to 19 mg cm(-2)), and a super-long-life stability of 106% capacitance retention after 115000 charge/discharge cycles. By using an ionic liquid electrolyte and an activated carbon anode, asymmetric supercapacitors (AScs) are also constructed and can be packaged into a high performance miniaturized energy storage component in either a tailorable or surface mountable configuration. Our ASc shows superior performance characteristics, with typical figures of merit including maximum energy densities of 47.9 W h kg(-1) at 270 W kg(-1) and 19.1 W h kg(-1) at the maximum power density of 20.8 kW kg(-1). The capacitance retention of the ASc is 96% after 80 000 charge/discharge cycles, which is the most excellent stability performance in an ionic liquid electrolyte as compared with the recently reported pseudo-supercapacitors. This technology may find vast applications in future miniaturized portable and wearable electronics.									236	13	0	0	20	0	236			1754-5692	1754-5706											2017-04-01	WOS:000398909900012

This review covers recent approaches to not only increase the power density, rate capability, cyclic stability, etc. of supercapacitors, but also to increase their energy density using hybrid architectures. Electrodes are the most important component of a supercapacitor cell, and thus this review primarily deals with the design of hybrid supercapacitor electrodes offering a high specific capacitance, together with the elucidation of the mechanisms involved therein. The electrode performance significantly depends on the available surface area, porosity and conductivity of the component materials, and thus nano-structuring of the electrode is an elegant approach, which is discussed in the subsections for 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-dimensional hybrid materials, including some miscellaneous hybrids. The fabrication of different hybrid materials using metal oxides, metal sulfides, carbon materials, etc. with conducting polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole and their characterization are delineated from the literature data. Here, we primarily focus on the mechanism of energy storage by non-faradic electrical double-layer capacitance and faradaic pseudo-capacitance, discussing the contributions of different component mechanisms towards the total capacitance. In the hybrids, the impact of the component concentration operating via different mechanisms for charge storage on their final electrochemical performance is discussed. The specific capacitance, volumetric capacitance, charge-discharge cycles, Ragone plot, etc. of hybrid supercapacitors are described. Besides household and heavy-duty applications, the state-of-the-art future applications of supercapacitors in robotics, renewable and sustainable energy devices, wearable and self-healing supercapacitors, and biotechnology and their challenges in real-world applications with the scope of future work are elucidated.									230	3	0	0	7	0	231			2050-7488	2050-7496											2021-07-02	WOS:000674327000001

In this study, a novel hydrogel was synthesized by incorporating polydopamine-coated talc (PDA-talc) nanoflakes into a polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel inspired by the natural mussel adhesive mechanism. Dopamine molecules were intercalated into talc and oxidized, which enhanced the dispersion of talc and preserved catechol groups in the hydrogel. The resulting dopamine-talc-PAM (DTPAM) hydrogel showed a remarkable stretchability, with over 1000% extension and a recovery rate over 99%. It also displayed strong adhesiveness to various substrates, including human skin, and the adhesion strength surpassed that of commercial double-sided tape and glue sticks, even as the hydrogel dehydrated over time. Moreover, the DTPAM hydrogel could rapidly self-heal and regain its mechanical properties without needing any external stimuli. It showed excellent biocompatibility and improved cell affinity to human fibroblasts compared to the PAM hydrogel. When used as a strain sensor, the DTPAM hydrogel showed high sensitivity, with a gauge factor of 0.693 at 1000% strain, and was capable of monitoring various human motions such as the bending of a finger, knee, or elbow and taking a deep breath. Therefore, this hydrogel displays favorable attributes and is highly suitable for use in human-friendly biological devices.									323	7	0	0	44	0	323			1944-8244	1944-8252											2018-12-28	WOS:000436211500076	29863322

Recently, flexible SERS has attracted increasingly tremendous research interest due to its unique advantages compared to rigid substrate-based SERS. Here, the latest advances in flexible substrate-based SERS diagnostic devices are investigated in-depth. First, the intriguing prospect of point-of-care diagnostics is briefly described, followed by an introduction to the cutting-edge SERS technique. Then, the focus is moved from conventional rigid substrate-based SERS to the emerging flexible SERS technique. The main part of this report highlights the recent three categories of flexible SERS substrates, including actively tunable SERS, swab-sampling strategy, and the in situ SERS detection approach. Furthermore, other promising means of flexible SERS are also introduced. The flexible SERS substrates with low-cost, batch-fabrication, and easy-to-operate characteristics can be integrated into portable Raman spectroscopes for point-of-care diagnostics, which are conceivable to penetrate global markets and households as next-generation wearable sensors in the near future.									310	16	1	0	54	0	315				2198-3844											2019-10-09	WOS:000474199100001	31453071

Herein, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst is designed and fabricated by encapsulating Co nanoparticles in interconnected N-doped hollow porous carbon nanofibers (designated as Co@N-C/PCNF) using an ultrafast high-temperature shock technology. Benefiting from the synergistic effect and intrinsic activity of the Co-N-C moiety, as well as porous structure of carbon nanofibers, the Co@N-C/PCNF composite shows high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both OER (289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (half-wave potential of 0.85 V). The Co-N-C moiety in the composite can modulate the local environmental and electrical structure of the catalysts, thus optimizing the adsorption/desorption kinetics and decreasing the reaction barriers for promoting the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis.

To develop high-performance FPENGs, the significant relationship among material, structure and performance inspired us a rational design of FPENGs from Pdop-BaTiO3@P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite fiber mats with a hierarchically architected microstructure. In contrast with previous approaches, the polydopamine (Pdop) modified barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) nanoparticles have been anchored onto the surface of electrospun poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE) fibers to fabricate hierarchical micro-structured membrane in this study, which not only effectively avoids the agglomeration of nanofillers but also enhances the density of interfaces in the nanocomposites. As a result, the as-fabricated FPENGs show a significantly enhanced output of 6 V and 1.5 mu A as compared to the PENG with only P(VDF-TrFE) membrane (1.25 V and 0.6 mu A). Furthermore, output voltage of the new FPENGs is 40%-68% higher than that of composite membranes with nanoparticles at the interior of nanofibers. The improved output of the PENG is attributed to the high density of interfaces in the hierarchical microstructure and the corresponding enhancement of dielectric response. Then, electric performance of FPENGs was investigated in terms of force, frequency and load resistance. Finally, the FPENG was employed to efficiently detect human body movements as self-powered sensors. The hierarchical nanocomposite membrane designed in this study provides an effective approach for developing mechanical energy harvesters, wearable sensor network and self-powered devices.									156	5	0	0	11	0	158			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-04-01	WOS:000521052900044

It is still challenging to prepare ultrafast flexible devices with high energy/power density and satisfactory stability. Herein, two-dimensional ultrathin vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanosheets grown directly on titanium (Ti) substrate (V2O5-Ti) are prepared as a novel flexible cathode with high energy density for ultrafast aqueous and flexible ZIBs. Benefiting from the merits of exposed active sites and increased electrical conductivity, our optimized V2O5-Ti cathode exhibits a remarkable discharge capacity of 503.1 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and long-term stability with 86% retention after over 700 cycles at 500 mA g(-1) in the aqueous coin cell. The charge storage mechanism of this V2O5-Ti cathode is investigated by insitu Raman spectroscopy, ex-situ X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Remarkably, based on this flexible cathode, we designed an ultrafast and flexible quasi-solid-state zinc ion battery (f-V2O5-TV/Zn), which can achieve the capacity of 377.5 mAh g(-1) and energy density of 622 Wh kg(-1) when charged at 4 A g(-1) for less than 6 min. It also exhibits the power density of 6.4 kW kg(-1) at an ultrahigh current density of 20 A g(-1), which outperforms most previously reported aqueous/flexible ZIBs. As a result of superior performance, our ultrafast flexible quasi-solid-state ZIB is believed to be a promising candidate for flexible and wearable energy storage systems.									178	13	0	0	5	0	179			2211-2855	2211-3282											2020-04-06	WOS:000521052900002

Although this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pokemon Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide.Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pokemon Go on physical activity.Methods: We study the effect of Pokemon Go on physical activity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months. Pokemon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical activity is measured through accelerometers.Results: We find that Pokemon Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on average, a more than 25% increase compared with their prior activity level (P<.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pokemon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore, Pokemon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health. In particular, we find that Pokemon Go is able to reach low activity populations, whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from an already very active population.Conclusions: Mobile apps combining game play with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to reach activity-poor populations. Future studies are needed to investigate potential long-term effects of these applications.									276	2	1	0	16	2	281			1438-8871												2016-12-01	WOS:000391065600007	27923778

Herein, a highly rechargeable, flexible, fiber-shaped Ni-Zn battery with impressive electrochemical performance is rationally demonstrated by employing Ni-NiO heterostructured nanosheets as the cathode. Benefiting from the improved conductivity and enhanced electroactivity of the Ni-NiO heterojunction nanosheet cathode, the as-fabricated fiber-shaped Ni-NiO//Zn battery displays high capacity and admirable rate capability. More importantly, this Ni-NiO//Zn battery shows unprecedented cyclic durability both in aqueous (96.6% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles) and polymer (almost no capacity attenuation after 10 000 cycles at 22.2 A g(-1)) electrolytes. Moreover, a peak energy density of 6.6 mu Wh cm(-2), together with a remarkable power density of 20.2 mW cm(-2), is achieved by the flexible quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped Ni-NiO//Zn battery, outperforming most reported fiber-shaped energy-storage devices. Such a novel concept of a fiber-shaped Ni-Zn battery with impressive stability will greatly enrich the flexible energy-storage technologies for future portable/wearable electronic applications.									288	15	0	0	9	0	287			0935-9648	1521-4095											2017-11-27	WOS:000415905200003	28991385

Recent key materials innovation focuses on developing advanced thermal interface of electronic packaging for achieving efficient heat dissipation. Here, for the first time we report a record-high performance thermal interface beyond the current state of the art, based on self-assembled manufacturing of cubic boron arsenide (s-BAs). The s-BAs exhibits highly desirable characteristics of high thermal conductivity up to 21W/m.K and excellent elastic compliance similar to that of soft biological tissues down to 100kPa through the rational design of BAs microcrystals in polymer composite. In addition, the s-BAs demonstrates high flexibility and preserves the high conductivity over at least 500 bending cycles, opening up new application opportunities for flexible thermal cooling. Moreover, we demonstrated device integration with power LEDs and measured a superior cooling performance of s-BAs beyond the current state of the art, by up to 45 degrees C reduction in the hot spot temperature. Together, this study demonstrates scalable manufacturing of a new generation of energy-efficient and flexible thermal interface that holds great promise for advanced thermal management of future integrated circuits and emerging applications such as wearable electronics and soft robotics. Well-developed prototype interface materials for electronics thermal management are limited to a low thermal conductivity or high elastic modulus. Here, the authors report flexible thermal interfaces through self-assembled manufacturing of polymetric composites based on the high thermal conductivity of cubic boron arsenide.									70	3	0	0	5	0	70				2041-1723											2021-04-19	WOS:000626610200027	33627644

Here, we develop a continuous dry-wet spinning approach to fabricate stretchable, conductive and self-healing hydrogel fibers. By tuning the contents of acrylamide (AAm) and N-acryloylglycinamide (NAGA), the physically cross-linked poly (NAGAco-AAm) (PNA) hydrogel precursor exhibits thermally reversible sol-gel transition, which ensures the success of the spinning process. The obtained PNA hydrogel fiber achieves excellent tensile strength (2.27 Mpa), stretchability (900%), high conductivity (0.69 S m(-1)), and self-healing capability. With an elastomeric poly (methyl acrylate) (PMA) coating, the PNA/PMA core-sheath fiber shows excellent resistance to water evaporation and absorption. The strain sensing capability of the PNA/PMA fiber is demonstrated for monitoring human body motions. Furthermore, a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) textile woven from the PNA/PMA fibers is fabricated to convert mechanical motion energy into electric power. Our stretchable conductive hydrogel fibers suggest great potentials for next-generation multifunctional smart textiles and wearable electronics.									133	2	0	0	13	0	133			2211-2855	2211-3282											2021-01-11	WOS:000596610800003

To enhance the sensing performance, the graphene oxide (GO), poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) and Ag colloids (AC) were used to modify the porous graphene. The humidity properties of porous based graphene networks have been investigated at different relative humidity (RH). The porous based graphene sensors exhibit excellent capability of monitoring different breathing patterns including mouse and nose respiration, normal and deep respiration. Besides, the signal variations before and after water intake was recorded by the sensor, which demonstrates the ability to monitor water loss during breathing period. Furthermore, the humidity sensor shows the ability to detect physiological activities including skin moisture, speaking and whistle rhythm, which could be a promising electronic for clinical respiration monitoring.									199	11	0	0	16	0	203			0956-5663	1873-4235											2018-12-28	WOS:000437068800014	29879538

However, the large thickness and poor mechanical properties of many EMI shielding materials usually limit their applications. In this study, ultrathin and highly flexible Ti3C2Tx (d-Ti3C2Tx,, MXene)/cellulose nanofiber (CNF) composite paper with a nacre-like lamellar structure is fabricated via a vacuum-filtration-induced self-assembly process. By the interaction between one-dimensional (1D) CNFs and two-dimensional (2D) d-Ti3C2Tx MXene, the binary strengthening and toughening of the nacre-like d-Ti3C2Tx/CNF composite paper has been successfully achieved, leading to high tensile strength (up to 135.4 MPa) and fracture strain (up to 16.7%), as well as excellent folding endurance (up to 14 260 times). Moreover, the d-Ti3C2Tx/CNF composite paper exhibits high electrical conductivity (up to 739.4 S m(-1)) and excellent specific EMI shielding efficiency (up to 2647 dB cm(2) g(-1)) at an ultrathin thickness (minimum thickness 47 mu m). The nacre-inspired strategy in this study offers a promising approach for the design and preparation of the strong integrated and flexible MXene/CNF composite paper, which may be applied in various fields such as flexible wearable devices, weapon equipment, and robot joints.									707	57	0	0	73	0	721			1936-0851	1936-086X											2018-12-28	WOS:000433404500055	29709183

Herein, a novel fluidic photo-thermal structure integrated with a brine-drenching induced electricity generator is reported for simultaneous clean water and power production. The fluidic photothermal structure is capable of sustaining solar-thermal distillation systems (e.g. interfacial and multi-stage configurations) at high energy conversion efficiency while completely preventing salt formation from occurring in the long-term desalination process, by taking advantage of unidirectional brine fluid transportation. The brin-drenching induced electricity allows immediate power generation with a piece of wet fabric only. Furthermore, the fabric-based energy generator exhibits remarkable programmable properties, and we have also demonstrated that power generation is also achievable with different water sources such as human sweat, groundwater and rainwater, which opens up exciting applications in various fields of energy harvesting and water detection systems, and provides a promising solution for sustainable powering of wearable devices and electronics.									117	4	0	0	6	0	117			1754-5692	1754-5706											2021-01-12	WOS:000599751100020

Because of the abundant surface terminations, MXenes have been compounded with various materials by multi-interactions. In addition to the prevented aggregation and oxidation of MXene flakes, the MXene/polymer membranes exhibit outstanding mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties due to the synergistic effects. However, relatively little is currently known about the MXene/polymer membranes and a special review on the progress of the synthesis, properties, and applications of MXene/polymer membranes has not been reported to date. Herein, this Review starts with an introduction of the synthesis and properties of MXenes. Then the development of MXene/polymer membranes will be discussed, which aims to summarize various approaches of fabricating MXene/polymer membranes and their fascinating properties. The focus then turns to their exciting potential applications in various fields such as filtration, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, energy storage devices, wearable electronics, etc. Finally, outlooks and perspectives for the future challenges and prospects of MXene/polymer membranes are provided.									302	17	0	0	28	0	308			0897-4756	1520-5002											2020-03-10	WOS:000519337600001

In elec-trochemical supercapacitors (ESCs), due to its physical and chemical properties, the electrolyte is the influencing element that determines the performance of the devices in terms of capacity, power density, energy density, speed performance, stability and safety. The current state of understanding of the electrode-electrolyte inter-action in ESCs is at the core of this topic. There are numerous types of electrolytes, including aqueous, organic, ionic liquids, solid or quasi-solid electrolytes, and redox active electrolytes. The latest types of electrolytes for SCs are discussed here.

However, existing conductors usually cannot meet all the requirements for use in next-generation wearable sensors. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of nature-inspired ionic conductors based on supramolecular sodium alginate (SA) nanofibrillar double network (DN) hydrogels with complex shapes by injection. Owing to their dermis-mimicking structures, these hydrogels exhibit unique features, such as high transparency (99.6%), high tension/compression strength (0.750 MPa/4 MPa), high stretchability (3120%), high toughness (4.77 MJ m(-3)) and superior elasticity (100%) at high strain (1000%). In particular, the use of salts (e.g., NaCl) as triggers in supramolecular assembly combining SA makes the hydrogels ideal ionic conductors. The ionic conductors were demonstrated as strain sensors with high sensitivity to an extremely broad strain window (0.3-1800%) and a low applied voltage (down to 0.04 V), as well as with high pressure sensitivity (1.45 kPa(-1)). These hydrogel-based ionic sensors may find applications in sports monitoring, human/machine interfaces and soft robotics.									276	14	0	0	47	0	279			2051-6347	2051-6355											2019-03-08	WOS:000459726900006

However, the limited stretchability, low toughness, and fatigue resistance lead to a narrow sensing region and insufficient durability of the hydrogel-based sensors. In this work, an extremely stretchable, highly tough, and anti-fatigue conductive nanocomposite hydrogel is prepared by integrating hydrophobic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into hydrophobically associated polyacrylamide (HAPAAm) hydrogel. In this conductive hydrogel, amphiphilic sodium dodecyl sulfate was used to ensure uniform dispersion of CNTs in the hydrogel network, and hydrophobic interactions between the hydrogel matrix and the CNT surface formed, greatly improving the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The obtained CNTs/HAPAAm hydrogel showed excellent stretchability (ca. 3000%), toughness (3.42 MJ m(-3)), and great anti-fatigue property. Moreover, it exhibits both high tensile strain sensitivity in the wide strain ranges (gauge factor = 4.32, up to 1000%) and high linear sensitivity (0.127 kPa(-1)) in a large-pressure region within 0-50 kPa. The CNTs/HAPAAm hydrogel-based sensors can sensitively and stably detect full-range human activities (e.g., elbow rotation, finger bending, swallowing motion, and pronouncing) and handwriting, demonstrating the CNTs/HAPAAm hydrogel's potential as the wearable strain and pressure sensors for flexible devices.									160	4	0	0	21	0	163			1944-8244	1944-8252											2020-01-29	WOS:000510532000081	31912722

To interact with their environment, soft robots require artificial muscles to actuate movement. These artificial muscles need to be as strong, fast, and robust as their natural counterparts. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising soft transducers, but typically exhibit low output forces and low energy densities when used without rigid supports. Here, we report a soft composite DEA made of strain-stiffening elastomers and carbon nanotube electrodes, which demonstrates a peak energy density of 19.8 J/kg. The result is close to the upper limit for natural muscle (0.4-40 J/kg), making these DEAs the highest-performance electrically driven soft artificial muscles demonstrated to date. To obtain high forces and displacements, we used low-density, ultrathin carbon nanotube electrodes which can sustain applied electric fields upward of 100 V/mu m without suffering from dielectric breakdown. Potential applications include prosthetics, surgical robots, and wearable devices, as well as soft robots capable of locomotion and manipulation in natural or human-centric environments.									194	6	0	0	10	0	197			0027-8424												2019-02-12	WOS:000458365600018	30679271

It targets real-time classification with a collection of inertial sensors while addressing issues regarding the occurrence of transitions between activities and unknown activities to the learning algorithm. We propose two implementations of the architecture which differ in their prediction technique as they deal with transitions either by directly learning them or by considering them as unknown activities. This is accomplished by combining the probabilistic output of consecutive activity predictions of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a heuristic filtering approach. The architecture is validated over three case studies that involve data from people performing a broad spectrum of activities (up to 33), while carrying smartphones or wearable sensors. Results show that TAHAR outperforms state-of-the-art baseline works and reveal the main advantages of the architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the past few decades, a plethora of pioneering studies have been implemented to explore the cell-hydrogel matrix interactions and figure out the underlying mechanisms, paving the way to the lab-to-clinic translation of hydrogel-based therapies. In this review, we first introduced the physicochemical properties of hydrogels and their fabrication approaches concisely. Subsequently, the comprehensive description and deep discussion were elucidated, wherein the influences of different hydrogels properties on cell behaviors and cellular signaling events were highlighted. These behaviors or events included integrin clustering, focal adhesion (FA) complex accumulation and activation, cytoskeleton rearrangement, protein cyto-nuclei shuttling and activation (e.g., Yes-associated protein (YAP), catenin, etc.), cellular compartment reorganization, gene expression, and further cell biology modulation (e.g., spreading, migration, proliferation, lineage commitment, etc.). Based on them, current in vitro and in vivo hydrogel applications that mainly covered diseases models, various cell delivery protocols for tissue regeneration and disease therapy, smart drug carrier, bioimaging, biosensor, and conductive wearable/implantable biodevices, etc. were further summarized and discussed.

However, it remains a critical challenge to simultaneously achieve a high sensitivity, broad sensing range (up to 30 kPa), fast response, long-term durability, and robust environmental degradability to achieve full-scale biomonitoring and decreased electronic waste. MXenes, which are two-dimensional layered structures with a large specific surface area and high conductivity, are widely employed in electrochemical energy devices. Here, we present a highly sensitive, flexible, and degradable pressure sensor fabricated by sandwiching porous MXene-impregnated tissue paper between a biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) thin sheet and an interdigitated electrode-coated PLA thin sheet. The flexible pressure sensor exhibits high sensitivity with a low detection limit (10.2 Pa), broad range (up to 30 kPa), fast response (11 ms), low power consumption (10(-8) W), great reproducibility over 10 000 cycles, and excellent degradability. It can also be used to predict the potential health status of patients and act as an electronic skin (E-skin) for mapping tactile stimuli, suggesting potential in personal healthcare monitoring, clinical diagnosis, and next generation artificial skins.									424	32	0	0	38	0	430			1530-6984	1530-6992											2019-02-01	WOS:000459222300069	30657695

However, such highly sophisticated intelligence has been mainly found in natural creatures while rarely realized in artificial materials. Herein, we fabricate a type of biomimetic iontronics to imitate natural skins using supramolecular polyelectrolyte hydrogels. The dynamic viscoelastic networks provide the biomimetic skin with a wide spectrum of mechanical properties, including flexible reconfiguration ability, robust elasticity, extremely large stretchability, autonomous self-healability, and recyclability. Meanwhile, polyelectrolytes' ionic conductivity allows multiple sensory capabilities toward temperature, strain, and stress. This work provides not only insights into dynamic interactions and sensing mechanism of supramolecular iontronics, but may also promote the development of biomimetic skins with sophisticated intelligence similar to natural skins.									393	25	0	0	48	0	398			2041-1723												2018-03-19	WOS:000427698700003	29555905

Perspectives from hardware, software, design, and value								TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS				35	1			103	113				10.1016/j.tele.2017.10.002							Article	APR 2018	2018	Although wearable devices are popular in recent years, the market share of smartwatches is relatively low. The main goal of this research is to investigate the antecedents of the intention to purchase a smartwatch. This research develops a conceptual model and hypotheses based on the theory of reasoned action and perceived values from the perspectives of software, hardware, and aesthetic design. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed on popular websites to collect data, and 260 usable responses are collected from the potential users of the Apple Watch in Taiwan. The thirteen hypotheses were validated by using partial least squares (PLS) techniques. Among the antecedents of purchase intention in the model, the attitude towards using smartwatches was found to have the strongest direct effect. Among the factors of the attitude, design aesthetics have the most significant effect. The results also show that all of the factors about smartwatch attributes directly affected the related perceived values. However, social value and performance/quality value did not affect the intention. The model demonstrated relatively good explanatory power for purchase intention in the context of smartwatches. The proposed model can provide insights to smartwatch vendors to develop their new products and marketing strategies.									97	0	0	0	3	0	97			0736-5853												2018-04-01	WOS:000423887400009

However, The traditional WBANs devices have limited computing and storage capabilities. These restrictions limit the services that WBANs can provide to users. Thus the concept of Cloud-aided WBANs has been proposed to enhance the capabilities of WBANs. In addition, due to the openness of the cloud computing environment, the protection of the user's physiological information and privacy remains a major concern. In previous authentication protocols, few of them can protect the user's private information in insecure channel. In this paper, we propose a cloud-aided lightweight certificateless authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless body area networks. Our protocol ensures that no one can obtain user's real identity except for the network manager in the registration phase. Moreover, in the authentication phase, the network manager cannot know the user's real identity. Note that, through the security analysis, we can conclude that our protocol can provide stronger security protection of private information than most of existing schemes in insecure channel.									182	3	0	0	1	0	185			1084-8045												2018-12-28	WOS:000428095700010

Aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as a kind of burgeoning building blocks realize multifunctional applications in diversified fields for their innate extinguished mechanical property and thermal stability. Limited by their high insulating property, in this work ANFs were designed to integrate with a 2D emerging MXene sheet with a distinct conductive property. Herein, we report an MXene/ANFs composite aerogel through a feasible controllable vacuum filtration followed by a freeze-drying process. Benefiting from the inerratic 3D hierarchical and "mortar-brick" porous structure with an ultralow density of 25 mg/cm(3), MXene/ANFs aerogels are proved to possess high compressible resilience and appealing sensing performance up to 1000 times. Importantly, verified by a series of simulation experiments, the MXene/ANFs aerogel sensor shows a wide detection range (2.0-80.0% compression strain), sensitive sensing property (128 kPa(-1)), and ultralow detection limit (100 Pa), which still play a flexible role in detecting human light movement and even vigorous sports after undergoing ultrahigh devastating pressures (similar to 623 kPa). In addition, the MXene/ANFs aerogel sensor can withstand a harsh high temperature of 200 degrees C and shows excellent flame resistance. The MXene/ANFs aerogel with excellent integrated property, especially the highly sensitive sensing property and excellent thermal stability, presents great potential for a human behavior monitoring sensor and sensing under certain extreme conditions.									184	20	0	0	16	0	192			1936-0851	1936-086X											2020-09-18	WOS:000566341000125	32790287

However, its inherent low thermal conductivity coefficient (lambda) values might threaten the safety of devices under a high-power working condition. In this work, polydopamine-functionalized boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS@PDA)/ANF thermally conductive composite papers with nacre-mimetic layered structures were prepared via highly efficient vacuum-assisted filtration followed by hot pressing. For a given BNNS loading, the surface functionalization of BNNS could further enhance the thermal conductivities and mechanical properties of BNNS@PDA/ANF composite papers. BNNS@PDA/ANF composite papers presented anisotropic thermal conductivities, and the through-plane (lambda(perpendicular to)) and in-plane (lambda(parallel to)) values of the 50 wt % BNNS@PDA/ANF composite papers reached 0.62 and 3.94 W/mK, 181.8 and 196.2% higher than those of original ANF paper, respectively, which were also higher than those of 50 wt % BNNS/ANF composite papers (lambda(perpendicular to) = 0.52 W/mK and lambda(parallel to) = 3.33 W/mK). The tensile strength of the 50 wt % BNNS@PDA/ANF composite papers reached 36.8 MPa, 30.5% higher than that of 50 wt % BNNS/ANF composite papers (28.2 MPa). In addition, the heat resistance index (T-HRI) of the 50 wt % BNNS@PDA/ANF composite papers was further increased to 223.1 degrees C. Overall, our fabricated BNNS@PDA/ANF composite papers possess highly thermal conductivities, excellent mechanical robustness and flexibility, and outstanding thermal stabilities, showing great potential applications in the fields of intelligent wearable equipment, flexible supercapacitors, and flexible electronics.									197	21	0	0	16	0	203			1944-8244	1944-8252											2020-02-20	WOS:000507146100171	31820630

In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) is also emerging and evolving by recent breakthroughs in computing power and software architectures. In this regard, the digital twin, analyzing various sensor data with the help of AI algorithms, has become a cutting-edge technology that connects the physical and virtual worlds, in which the various sensors are highly desirable to collect environmental information. However, although existing sensor technologies, including cameras, microphones, inertial measurement units, etc., are widely used as sensing elements for various applications, high-power consumption and battery replacement of them is still a problem. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as self-powered sensors supply a feasible platform for realizing self-sustainable and low-power systems. Herein, the recent progress on TENG-based intelligent systems, that is, wearable electronics, robot-related systems, and smart homes, followed by prospective future development enabled by sensor fusion technology, is focused on. Finally, how to apply artificial intelligence to the design of intelligent sensor systems for the 5G and IoT era is discussed.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38				2640-4567											2022-04-13	WOS:000774539900001

Herein, for the first time, a novel Al-intercalation engineering of MnO2 cathode has been proposed for aqueous ZIBs, in which the structural regulation and Zn2+ storage performance of Al-intercalated MnO2 (denoted as AMO) cathode are deeply investigated. Electrochemical testing results indicate significant improvement in specific capacity (401.7 mAh g-1) and cycling retention (-94.5% over 2000 cycles) of the AMO cathode, which is owing to the effective Al-intercalation that result in the formation of strong Al-O bonds in tunnel-type MnO2 framework. This reasonable configuration not only optimizes charge/ion state and electronic bandgap, but also ensures reversible phase transition and alleviates the Mn dissolution of AMO cathode, which are further demonstrated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in-situ Raman investigation upon charging-discharging. As a proof of concept, coin-type and flexible aqueous ZIBs based on such AMO cathode are effectively fabricated, and they both achieve excellent electrochemical behaviors, revealing the great potential applications in energy technologies and portable/ wearable electronics.									63	4	0	0	3	0	65			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-07-22	WOS:000672588000004

The good self-healing, biocompatible, sensitive and stretchable properties are the focus of hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors. Dual network (DN) hydrogels are hopeful to fabricate self-healing hydrogels with the above properties. Here, multifunctional DN hydrogels are prepared via a combination of host-guest interaction of beta-cyclodextrin and ferrocene with dynamic borate ester bonds of poly(vinyl alcohol) and borax. Carbon nanotubes are used to endow the DN hydrogels with good conductivity. The obtained DN composite hydrogels possess good biocompatibility, stretchability (436%), fracture strength (41.0 KPa), self-healing property (healing efficiency of 95%), and high tensile strain sensitivity (gauge factor of 5.9). The DN composite hydrogels are used as flexible strain sensors to detect different human motions. After cutting, the healed hydrogels also can monitor human motions and have good stability.

Here, a highly stretchable, sensitive, and multifunctional polysaccharide-based dual-network hydrogel sensor was constructed using dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose (DCMC), chitosan (CS), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and aluminum ions (Al3+). The obtained DCMC/CS/PAA (DCP) composite hydrogels exhibit robust mechanical strength and good adhesive and self-healing properties, due to the reversible dynamic chemical bonds and physical interactions such as Schiff base bonds and metal coordination. The conductivity of hydrogel is 2.6 S/m, and the sensitivity (gauge factor (GF)) is up to 15.56. Notably, the DCP hydrogel shows excellent underwater repeatable adhesion to animal tissues and good self-healing properties in water (self-healing rate > 90%, self-healing time < 10 min). The DCP hydrogel strain sensor can sensitively monitor human motion including finger bending, smiling, and wrist pulse, and it can steadily detect human movement underwater. This work is expected to provide a new strategy for the design of high-performance intelligent sensors, particularly for applications in wet and underwater environments.									50	2	0	0	7	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252											2022-07-12	WOS:000820948300001	35580208

Here, an ultra-stretchable and self-cleaning nonwoven textile-based bioelectrode combining prominent health monitoring performance with outstanding anti-fouling ability is rationally designed and successfully fabricated via the synergistic combination of carbon black nanoparticle/CNT (CB/CNT) stretchable conductive networks and superhydrophobic perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane modified TiO2 nanoparticles (PFOTES-TiO2 NPs). The adaptive CB/CNT conductive networks on elastic fibers can facilitate efficient charge transfer under ultra-high deformation (> 10 times stretching), while the outermost PFOTES-TiO2 NPs layer with good interlayer adhesion provides the micro-topological structure and low surface energy. As a result, the conductive textile used as skin-attachable bioelectrode manifests remarkable performance for personal health monitoring, including an ultra-broad detection range of 1050.0% and an extremely high GF value up to 1134.7 as wearable strain sensor, and outstanding detection ability to electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) signals.

Developments in mobile technologies have created a role for images in the assessment of dietary intake. The objective of this review was to examine peer-reviewed published papers covering development, evaluation and/ or validation of image-assisted or image-based dietary assessment methods from December 2013 to January 2016. Images taken with handheld devices or wearable cameras have been used to assist traditional dietary assessment methods for portion size estimations made by dietitians (image-assisted methods). Image-assisted approaches can supplement either dietary records or 24-h dietary recalls. In recent years, image-based approaches integrating application technology for mobile devices have been developed (image-based methods). Image-based approaches aim at capturing all eating occasions by images as the primary record of dietary intake, and therefore follow the methodology of food records. The present paper reviews several image-assisted and image-based methods, their benefits and challenges; followed by details on an image-based mobile food record. Mobile technology offers a wide range of feasible options for dietary assessment, which are easier to incorporate into daily routines. The presented studies illustrate that image-assisted methods can improve the accuracy of conventional dietary assessment methods by adding eating occasion detail via pictures captured by an individual (dynamic images). All of the studies reduced underreporting with the help of images compared with results with traditional assessment methods. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better delineate attributes with regards to age of user, degree of error and cost.

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities and versatility in delivering self-powered and wear-optimized biomedical sensors, and are paving the way for a novel platform technology able to fully integrate into the developing 5G/Internet-of-Things ecosystem. This novel paradigm of TENG-based biomedical sensors aspires to provide ubiquitous and omnipresent real-time biomedical sensing for us all. In this review, we cover the remarkable developments in TENG-based biomedical sensing which have arisen in the last octennium, focusing on both in-body and on-body biomedical sensing solutions. We begin by covering TENG as biomedical sensors in the most relevant, mortality-associated clinical fields of pneumology and cardiology, as well as other organ-related biomedical sensing abilities including ambulation. We also include an overview of ambient biomedical sensing as a field of growing interest in occupational health monitoring. Finally, we explore TENGs as power sources for third party biomedical sensors in a number of fields, and conclude our review by focusing on the future perspectives of TENG biomedical sensors, highlighting key areas of attention to fully translate TENG-based biomedical sensors into clinically and commercially viable digital and wireless consumer and health products.									114	4	0	0	15	0	113			0956-5663	1873-4235											2021-01-15	WOS:000603555000006	33068881

Rendering such electronics soft and stretchable-like human skin-would make them more comfortable to wear, and, through increased contact area, would greatly enhance the fidelity of signals acquired from the skin. Structural engineering of rigid inorganic and organic devices has enabled circuit-level stretchability, but this requires sophisticated fabrication techniques and usually suffers from reduced densities of devices within an array(2,10-12). We reasoned that the desired parameters, such as higher mechanical deformability and robustness, improved skin compatibility and higher device density, could be provided by using intrinsically stretchable polymer materials instead. However, the production of intrinsically stretchable materials and devices is still largely in its infancy(13-15): such materials have been reported(11,16-19), but functional, intrinsically stretchable electronics have yet to be demonstrated owing to the lack of a scalable fabrication technology. Here we describe a fabrication process that enables high yield and uniformity from a variety of intrinsically stretchable electronic polymers. We demonstrate an intrinsically stretchable polymer transistor array with an unprecedented device density of 347 transistors per square centimetre. The transistors have an average charge-carrier mobility comparable to that of amorphous silicon, varying only slightly (within one order of magnitude) when subjected to 100 per cent strain for 1,000 cycles, without current-voltage hysteresis. Our transistor arrays thus constitute intrinsically stretchable skin electronics, and include an active matrix for sensory arrays, as well as analogue and digital circuit elements. Our process offers a general platform for incorporating other intrinsically stretchable polymer materials, enabling the fabrication of next-generation stretchable skin electronic devices.									1294	77	0	0	98	0	1319			0028-0836	1476-4687											2018-03-01	WOS:000426247600036	29466334

Understanding the role of the choice of materials and the filler-matrix architecture is critical to achieving desired functionality of a composite towards applications in flexible electronics and energy harvest devices. Herein, a high-throughput phase-field simulation is conducted to systematically reveal the influence of morphology and spatial orientation of an oxide filler on the piezoelectric, mechanical, and dielectric properties of the piezoelectric nanocomposites. It is discovered that with a constant filler volume fraction, a composite composed of vertical pillars exhibits superior piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling coefficient as compared to the other geometric configurations. An analytical regression is established from a linear regression-based machine learning model, which can be employed to predict the performance of nanocomposites filled with oxides with a given set of piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric permittivity, and stiffness. This work not only sheds light on the fundamental mechanism of piezoelectric nanocomposites, but also offers a promising material design strategy for developing high-performance polymer/inorganic oxide composite-based wearable electronics.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42				2198-3844											2022-03-23	WOS:000767506500001	35277947

However, it remains challenging to fabricate highly robust and stable transparent ionogels. Here, high-performance ionogels with excellent transparency, mechanical robustness, and ultrahigh stability are designed by virtue of hydrogen bonding between poly(ethyl acrylate)-based elastomers and room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs). Through rationally tuning the chemical structures of ILs and thus achieving good compatibility of ILs with elastomers, the transparent hydrophobic ionogels exhibit super-strong mechanical properties (favorable elasticity of 15-484 kPa, ultrahigh stretchability of more than 5000%, and record-high fracture toughness of up to 4.7 kJ m(-2)) and high stability (high thermal stability, high voltage stability, air stability, humidity resistance, strong self-adhesion, and non-corrosive stability). In particular, it is demonstrated that a skin-like sensor fabricated using the ionogel directly not only exhibits outstanding durability (10 000 cycles at 100% strain), but is also capable of operation under harsh environmental conditions, including high vacuum, high/low temperatures, and high humidity. It is believed that this work provides new prospects for sophisticated wearable optoelectronic devices.									185	7	0	0	12	0	186			2051-6347	2051-6355											2020-03-01	WOS:000519943400017

They can be used in an emerging market of flexible and wearable electronic gadgets. Gel polymer electrolytes are being considered as one of the best candidates. They typically have higher ionic conductivity than solid electrolytes without safety concerns of liquid electrolytes. This article reviews the latest achievements in the application of PVA-based gel polymer electrolytes for flexible supercapacitors and new findings on the improvement of their ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, and overall electrochemical performance. Several current kinds of research attempt to overcome these challenges with the main goal of improving ionic conductivity and electrochemical properties. There is no limitation for ionic conductivity of gel electrolyte because high ionic conductivity can lead to higher specific capacitance and also sufficient electrochemical performance. A recent study of gel electrolytes has shown the highest ionic conductivity of 82 mS.cm(-1) for PVA/H2SO4/Glutaraldehyde/H2O which results in a large areal capacitance of 488 mF.cm(-2) (100 reference).									195	4	0	0	9	0	196			2352-152X												2020-04-08	WOS:000516714200098

It is highly conductive, largely transmissive to light, processible in water, and highly flexible. Much recent work on this ubiquitous material has been devoted to increasing its deformability beyond flexibility-a characteristic possessed by any material that is sufficiently thin-toward stretchability, a characteristic that requires engineering of the structure at the molecular- or nanoscale. Stretchability is the enabling characteristic of a range of applications envisioned for PEDOT in energy and healthcare, such as wearable, implantable, and large-area electronic devices. High degrees of mechanical deformability allow intimate contact with biological tissues and solution-processable printing techniques (e.g., roll-to-roll printing). PEDOT:PSS, however, is only stretchable up to around 10%. Here, the strategies that have been reported to enhance the stretchability of conductive polymers and composites based on PEDOT and PEDOT:PSS are highlighted. These strategies include blending with plasticizers or polymers, deposition on elastomers, formation of fibers and gels, and the use of intrinsically stretchable scaffolds for the polymerization of PEDOT.									467	11	0	0	57	0	469			0935-9648	1521-4095											2019-03-08	WOS:000460329300020	30600559

Herein, based on synergistic hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and pi-pi interaction within regularly arranged layered porous structures, conductive carbon aerogels with cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are developed via bidirectional freezing and subsequent annealing. Benefiting from the porous architecture and high surface roughness, CNF/CNT/RGO carbon aerogels exhibit ultralow density (2.64 mg cm(-3)) and superhydrophilicity (water contact angle approximate to 0 degrees at 106 ms). The honeycomb-like ordered porous structure can efficiently transfer stress in the entire microstructure, thereby endowing carbon aerogels with high compressibility and extraordinary fatigue resistance (10,000 cycles at 50% strain). These aerogels can be assembled into compressive solid-state symmetric supercapacitors showing excellent area capacitance (109.4 mF cm(-2) at 0.4 mA cm(-2)) and superior long cycle compression performance (88% after 5000 cycles at compressive strain of 50%). Furthermore, the aerogels reveal good linear sensitivity (S = 5.61 kPa(-1)) and accurately capture human bio-signals as strain sensors. It is expected that such CNF/CNT/RGO carbon aerogels will provide a novel multifunctional platform for wearable electronics, electronic skin, and human motion monitoring.									111	4	0	0	24	0	111			1616-301X	1616-3028											2022-03-18	WOS:000764013100001

Nevertheless, the polymeric blend film, core to the photoelectric conversion of all-PSCs, has not been thoroughly understood in terms of the influence and regulatory factors of mechanical properties, which hinders the advances in flexible and wearable applications. Herein, a range of characterization methods is combined to investigate the mechanical properties, miscibility, and film microstructure of the blends based on several representative polymer donors (PTzBI-Si, PTVT-T, PM6 and PTQ10) and a benchmark polymer acceptor N2200, and to further reveal the miscibility-property relationships of the miscibility property. The results stress that fracture behaviors and elastic moduli of these blends with varied compositions show different changing trends, which are affected by molecular interactions and aggregated structure of the blends. The elastic moduli of the four all-polymer blends can be nicely predicted by different models that are deduced from macromolecular mechanics. Most crucially, the correlations between elastic modulus, morphology, and miscibility of all-polymer blends are elucidated for the first time. The derived relationships is validated with another high-efficiency blend and will be the key to the successful fabrication of mechanically robust and stretchable all-PSCs with high efficiency.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			1616-301X	1616-3028											2022-05-15	WOS:000791436000001

However, there is limited information about their inherent heat, light, and air stability and how different parameters such as the inorganic layer number and length of organic spacer molecule affect stability. To gain deeper understanding on the matter we have expanded the family of 2D R-P perovskites, by utilizing pentylamine (PA)(2)(MA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1-5, PA = CH (3) (CH (2) ) (4) NH (+)(3), C 5) and hexylamine (HA)(2)(MA)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1-4, HA = CH3(CH2)(5)NH3+, C6) as the organic spacer molecules between the inorganic slabs, creating two new series of layered materials, for up to n = 5 and 4 layers, respectively. The resulting compounds were extensively characterized through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods, including single crystal X-ray analysis. High resolution powder X-ray diffraction studies using synchrotron radiation shed light for the first time to the phase transitions of the higher layer 2D R-P perovskites. The increase in the length of the organic spacer molecules did not affect their optical properties; however, it has a pronounced effect on the air, heat, and light stability of the fabricated thin films. An extensive study of heat, light, and air stability with and without encapsulation revealed that specific compounds can be air stable (relative humidity (RH) = 20-80% +/- 5%) for more than 450 days, while heat and light stability in air can be exponentially increased by encapsulating the corresponding films. Evaluation of the out-of-plane mechanical properties of the corresponding materials showed that their soft and flexible nature can be compared to current commercially available polymer substrates (e.g., PMMA), rendering them suitable for fabricating flexible and wearable electronic devices.									156	11	0	0	5	0	158			0002-7863	1520-5126											2019-04-03	WOS:000463843700057	30827098

This article attempts to interpret the progress, direction, and purpose of current research on the effects of technology on work and organizations. After a review of key breakthroughs in the evolution of technology, we consider the disruptive effects of emerging information and communication technologies. We then examine numbers and types of jobs affected by developments in technology, and how this will lead to significant worker dislocation. To illustrate technology's impact on work, work systems, and organizations, we present four popular technologies: electronic monitoring systems, robots, teleconferencing, and wearable computing devices. To provide insights regarding what we know about the effects of technology for OP/OB scholars, we consider the results of research conducted from four different perspectives on the role of technology in management. We also examine how that role is changing in the emerging world of technology. We conclude by considering approaches to six human resources (HR) areas supported by traditional and emerging technologies, identifying related research questions that should have profound implications both for research and for practice, and providing guidance for future research.									256	0	2	0	6	5	259			2327-0608	2327-0616	978-0-8243-3803-9										2016-01-01	WOS:000373065600014

Scanning electron microscopy results indicated that RGO was localized on surfaces of the TPU fibers uniformly and formed conductive paths. The interaction between electrospun TPU fibers and RGO was investigated by using Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray diffraction. These fibers conductive paths connected with each other and constructed an excellent three-dimensional conductive network. The special hierarchical conductive network endowed our RGO/TPU strain sensors with a desirable integration of good stretchability and high sensitivity (gage factor (GF) of 11 in strain of 10% and 79 in strain of 100% in reversible strain regime), good durability and stability (stretch/release test of 6000 cycles) and a fast response speed. The mechanism of the evolution of residual resistance and residual strain of RGO/TPU strain sensors under cyclic loading were investigated in detail. RGO/TPU strain sensors were attached on skin or clothes to monitor various human motions. The results demonstrate that our flexible strain sensors have wide application prospects in smart wearable device. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The MC/PANI/Ag composite films are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. The synergistic effects of PANI and Ag-NPs on the electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity, electric modulus, complex impedance, and the energy density efficiency of MC polymeric film have been determined in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 5 MHz. The XRD and infrared spectroscopy, confirmed the successful fabrication of the MC/PANI/Ag composite films. The SEM images have indicated a homogenous loading and dispersion of Ag-NPs into the MC film. The electrical conductivity has increased from 4.14x10-9 S.cm? 1 for pure MC to 1.48x10-6 S.cm? 1 for MC/PANI/Ag-NPs. In addition, the dielectric constant epsilon' has increased from 0.62 for MC to 1.19 for MC/PANI/Ag-NPs at 100 Hz. These results confirmed that there are significant modifications on the fabricated films, which open the road for utilizing the MC/PANI/AgNPs as flexible films for wide range of electronic applications such as batteries, electronic circuit and supercapacitor's.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			1387-7003	1879-0259											2022-03-23	WOS:000761635900002		
J	Lin, Fengcai; Wang, Zi; Shen, Yanping; Tang, Lirong; Zhang, Pinle; Wang, Yuefang; Chen, Yandan; Huang, Biao; Lu, Beili								Natural skin-inspired versatile cellulose biomimetic hydrogels								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	46			26442	26455				10.1039/c9ta10502f							Article	DEC 14 2019	2019	Artificial skin-like materials have wide applications, particularly in flexible electronics. However, developing intelligent skin-like soft materials with a remarkable range of properties is still a challenge. Herein, a versatile biomimetic hydrogel inspired by natural skin was fabricated based on Ag/TA@CNC (cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) decorated with tannic acid (TA) and Ag nanoparticles) nanohybrids and polyvinyl alcohol via dynamic borate ester bond crosslinking, which realized the combination of superstretchability (>4000%), efficient (within 10 min, 98.6%) and repeatable self-healing property, conformability and mechano-stimuli sensitivity within a single structure. This skin-inspired hydrogel can be assembled as a self-healing flexible capacitive sensor to track human body motions with a relatively broad sensible range of strain (up to 400%). Meanwhile, the hydrogel can be further used for repairing circuits, constructing switches, programmed electrical circuit assembly, as electronic skin, and in touch screen pens. Moreover, the modified CNCs could be used as a functional trigger to endow the nanocomposite hydrogels with excellent antibacterial properties and repeatable self-adhesiveness, which also play an important role in bionic skin materials. Compared with previous skin-like materials, these nanocellulose biomimetic hydrogels achieve more favorable functionalities in mimicking natural skin, which can meet versatile application needs ranging from flexible/wearable/self-healable electronic devices to artificial electronic skin.									178	7	0	0	47	0	181			2050-7488	2050-7496											2019-12-25	WOS:000501213600025

Data acquired by the hosted sensors are usually processed by machine-learning-based algorithms to classify human activities. The success of those algorithms mostly depends on the availability of training (labeled) data that, if made publicly available, would allow researchers to make objective comparisons between techniques. Nowadays, there are only a few publicly available data sets, which often contain samples from subjects with too similar characteristics, and very often lack specific information so that is not possible to select subsets of samples according to specific criteria. In this article, we present a new dataset of acceleration samples acquired with an Android smartphone designed for human activity recognition and fall detection. The dataset includes 11,771 samples of both human activities and falls performed by 30 subjects of ages ranging from 18 to 60 years. Samples are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse grained classes: one containing samples of 9 types of activities of daily living (ADL) and the other containing samples of 8 types of falls. The dataset has been stored to include all the information useful to select samples according to different criteria, such as the type of ADL performed, the age, the gender, and so on. Finally, the dataset has been benchmarked with four different classifiers and with two different feature vectors. We evaluated four different classification tasks: fall vs. no fall, 9 activities, 8 falls, 17 activities and falls. For each classification task, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation (i.e., including samples from all the subjects in both the training and the test dataset) and a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (i.e., the test data include the samples of a subject only, and the training data, the samples of all the other subjects). Regarding the classification tasks, the major findings can be summarized as follows: (i) it is quite easy to distinguish between falls and ADLs, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. Indeed, these classes of activities present quite different acceleration shapes that simplify the recognition task; (ii) on average, it is more difficult to distinguish between types of falls than between types of activities, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. This is due to the similarity between the acceleration shapes of different kinds of falls. On the contrary, ADLs acceleration shapes present differences except for a small group. Finally, the evaluation shows that the presence of samples of the same subject both in the training and in the test datasets, increases the performance of the classifiers regardless of the feature vector used. This happens because each human subject differs from other subjects in performing activities even if she shares with them the same physical characteristics.									223	4	1	0	10	0	226				2076-3417											2017-11-19	WOS:000414457800139

However, the problem of the interference between sensing signals from different stimuli and the deficiency of comfortability for a long-time skin-attaching wearing still exist. Herein, we present an ultrathin and flexible bifunctional sensor based on two measurable parameters of pressure-induced supercapacitance and temperature-induced resistance with neglectable crosstalk between the two. The sensor consists of a planar iontronic supercapacitor underneath a serpentine resistor with assembly of total seven layers integrated on an electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based nanofiber platform. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-based sensing electrodes are patterned by a direct ink writing method with addition of graphene nanoflakes and Co3O4 nanoparticles to enhance the sensing performance. A high pressure sensitivity (147.19 kPa-1, 0-7 kPa; 4.41 kPa-1, 25-85 kPa) and a high temperature sensitivity (0.040 degrees C-1, 25-50 degrees C; 0.002 degrees C-1, 50-100 degrees C) are simultaneously achieved. The sensor also has the advantages of humidity inertness, waterproof ability and air permeability, which is breathable to obtain a wearing comfortability. Decoupled pressure-temperature sensing applications of detecting various subtle pressures by objects of different temperatures are demonstrated in a wireless and real-time mode. The proposed bifunctional sensor shows great potential in wearable healthcare monitoring.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212											2022-10-20	WOS:000867419200002

Herein, a single hydrothermal approach was used to effectively rivet the alpha-Fe2O3 to the functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene plates to prepare the alpha-Fe2O3/Ti3C2Tx MXene composites material with high specific surface area (29.2 m(2)/g) and abundant functional groups, forming a hybrid heterojunction structure. A side-heated sensor was manufactured and its sensing performance for a variety of vapors were measured experimentally. The morphology and crystal phase of the composite products were analyzed through a range of testing technique. The rose-like alpha-Fe2O3/Ti3C2Tx MXene sensor revealed a response value and rapid response/recovery times of 18.3% and below 2.5 s for 5 ppm NH3 gas at RT under relatively humidity (RH) of 22%. Meanwhile, it illustrated an excellent linear response in the vary of 5-100 ppm, excellent reversibility and the long-term stability. In addition, a plausible mechanism of the alpha-Fe2O3/Ti3C2Tx MXene sensor was predicted, and the adsorption capacity of composites material was confirmed by the support of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work is expected to provide a fresh idea for the design of other high properties RT gas sensors in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.
