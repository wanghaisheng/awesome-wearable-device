Although its first generation has revolutionized conventional lenses and enabled anomalous refraction, new classes of meta-optics can now shape light and dark features of an optical field with an unprecedented level of complexity and multifunctionality. Here, we review these efforts with a focus on metasurfaces that use different properties of input light-angle of incidence and direction, polarization, phase distribution, wavelength, and nonlinear behavior-as optical knobs for tuning the output response. We discuss ongoing advances in this area as well as future challenges and prospects. These recent developments indicate that optically tunable flat optics is poised to advance adaptive camera systems, microscopes, holograms, and portable and wearable devices and may suggest new possibilities in optical communications and sensing.									53	2	0	0	1	0	55			0036-8075	1095-9203											2022-05-13	WOS:000788553700031	35446661

The continual push toward lower operating voltages and power consumption in modern integrated circuits has made the development of devices powered by body heat finally feasible. In this context, thermoelectric (TE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for the effective conversion of body heat into electricity to power wearable devices without being limited by environmental conditions. Driven by rapid advances in processing technology and the performance of TE materials over the past two decades, wearable thermoelectric generators (WTEGs) have gradually become more flexible and stretchable so that they can be used on complex and dynamic surfaces. In this review, the functional materials, processing techniques, and strategies for the device design of different types of WTEGs are comprehensively covered. Wearable self-powered systems based on WTEGs are summarized, including multi-function TE modules, hybrid energy harvesting, and all-in-one energy devices. Challenges in organic TE materials, interfacial engineering, and assessments of device performance are discussed, and suggestions for future developments in the area are provided. This review will promote the rapid implementation of wearable TE materials and devices in self-powered electronic systems.									116	4	0	0	5	0	118			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-09-10	WOS:000692743700001	34486174

This Review examines the building blocks of wearable devices, including the substrate materials as well as the sensing, decision-making and power modules.Wearable devices provide an alternative pathway to clinical diagnostics by exploiting various physical, chemical and biological sensors to mine physiological (biophysical and/or biochemical) information in real time (preferably, continuously) and in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner. These sensors can be worn in the form of glasses, jewellery, face masks, wristwatches, fitness bands, tattoo-like devices, bandages or other patches, and textiles. Wearables such as smartwatches have already proved their capability for the early detection and monitoring of the progression and treatment of various diseases, such as COVID-19 and Parkinson disease, through biophysical signals. Next-generation wearable sensors that enable the multimodal and/or multiplexed measurement of physical parameters and biochemical markers in real time and continuously could be a transformative technology for diagnostics, allowing for high-resolution and time-resolved historical recording of the health status of an individual. In this Review, we examine the building blocks of such wearable sensors, including the substrate materials, sensing mechanisms, power modules and decision-making units, by reflecting on the recent developments in the materials, engineering and data science of these components. Finally, we synthesize current trends in the field to provide predictions for the future trajectory of wearable sensors.									55	0	0	0	3	0	55			2058-8437												2022-07-29	WOS:000828914600001	35910814

Since multi-sensor is defined by the presence of more than one model or channel, e.g. visual, audio, environmental and physiological signals. Hence, the fusion methods of multi-modality and multi-location sensors are proposed. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the stateoftheart on information fusion or deep learning, all of them only tackled one aspect of the sensor fusion applications, which leads to a lack of comprehensive understanding about it. Therefore, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of the fusion methods of wearable sensors. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of multi-sensor applications for human activity recognition, including those recently added to the field for unsupervised learning and transfer learning.

Fusing traditional textiles with diagnostic, therapeutic, and protective medical devices can unlock electronic textiles (e-textiles) as point-of-care platform technologies on the human body, continuously monitoring vital signs and implementing round-the-clock treatment protocols in close proximity to the patient. This review comprehensively summarizes the research advances on e-textiles for wearable point-of-care systems.

Then, we describe textile sensors for diagnosis, textile therapeutic devices for medical treatment, and textile protective devices for prevention, by highlighting their working mechanisms, representative materials, and clinical application scenarios. Afterward, we detail e-textiles' connection technologies as the gateway for real-time data transmission and processing in the context of 5G technologies and Internet of Things. Finally, we provide new insights into the remaining challenges and future directions in the field of e-textiles. Fueled by advances in chemistry and materials science, textile-based diagnostic devices, therapeutic devices, protective medical devices, and communication units are expected to interact synergistically to construct intelligent, wearable point-of-care textile platforms, ultimately illuminating the future of healthcare system in the Internet of Things era.									152	4	0	0	16	0	153			0009-2665	1520-6890											2022-01-07	WOS:000736837900001	34939791

Here we report the development and testing of a fully integrated wearable array of microneedles for the wireless and continuous real-time sensing of two metabolites (lactate and glucose, or alcohol and glucose) in the interstitial fluid of volunteers performing common daily activities. The device works with a custom smartphone app for data capture and visualization, comprises reusable electronics and a disposable microneedle array, and is optimized for system integration, cost-effective fabrication via advanced micromachining, easier assembly, biocompatibility, pain-free skin penetration and enhanced sensitivity. Single-analyte and dual-analyte measurements correlated well with the corresponding gold-standard measurements in blood or breath. Further validation of the technology in large populations with concurrent validation of sensor readouts through centralized laboratory tests should determine the robustness and utility of real-time simultaneous monitoring of several biomarkers in interstitial fluid.A wearable array of microneedle-based sensors can be used to wirelessly measure the levels of glucose simultaneously with those of alcohol or lactate in the interstitial fluid of volunteers performing common daily activities.									63	0	0	0	15	0	63			2157-846X												2022-05-18	WOS:000792563700001	35534575

However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (<1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze-thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.									55	0	0	0	5	0	55			0935-9648	1521-4095											2022-07-15	WOS:000822950600001	35726439

Here, we propose augmented tactile-perception and haptic-feedback rings with multimodal sensing and feedback capabilities. This highly integrated ring consists of triboelectric and pyroelectric sensors for tactile and temperature perception, and vibrators and nichrome heaters for vibro- and thermo-haptic feedback. All these components integrated on the ring can be directly driven by a custom wireless platform of low power consumption for wearable/portable scenarios. With voltage integration processing, high-resolution continuous finger motion tracking is achieved via the triboelectric tactile sensor, which also contributes to superior performance in gesture/object recognition with artificial intelligence analysis.

However, it is still a critical challenge for pressure sensors to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and wide sensing range while performing well in response time, stability, reliability and wearing comfortability. Here, conductive MXene/cotton fabric was fabricated using the simple dip-coating technique and then sandwiched between polydimethylsiloxane film and an interdigitated electrode for flexible wearable piezoresistive pressure sensor. The abundant hydroxyl groups of cotton fabric and functional groups of MXene were beneficial for the good adhesion of conductive MXene nanosheets onto the entangled fiber networks, constructing effective conductive network. Taking advantage of the excellent flexibility and three-dimensional porous structure of cotton fabric and the special sandwich architecture of the sensor, the MXene/cotton fabric (MCF) based pressure sensor exhibited high sensitivity (5.30 kPa(-1) in the pressure range of 0-1.30 kPa), broad sensing range (0-160 kPa), rapid response/recovery time (50 ms/20 ms), excellent stability and long-term durability. Moreover, the MCF based pressure sensor can be employed to detect and distinguish various human health signals, including finger motion, early stage Parkinson's static tremor and wrist pulse. Importantly, E-skin was also designed based on the MCF based pressure sensor for the recognition of different tactile stimuli, exhibiting promising potential in next generation wearable electronics.									170	8	0	0	14	0	170			1385-8947	1873-3212											2021-06-15	WOS:000664789900002

With polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as polymer matrix, the sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films are prepared via electrospinning-laying-hot pressing technology, where Fe3O4/PVA composite electrospun nanofibers in the top and bottom layers and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite electrospun nanofibers in the middle layer. Owing to the electrospinning process and the successful construction of the sandwich structure, when the amounts of Ti3C2Tx and Fe3O4 are respectively only 13.3 and 26.7 wt%, the EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of the sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films reach 40 dB with the thickness of 75 mu m, higher than that of (Fe3O4/Ti3C2Tx)/PVA EMI shielding nanocomposite films (21 dB) prepared based on blending-electrospinning-hot pressing process under the same amounts of fillers. Furthermore, the prepared sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films possess excellent thermal conductivities and mechanical properties. This novel kind of flexible sandwich-structured EMI shielding nanocomposite films with excellent EMI shielding performances, thermal conductivities, and mechanical properties presents broad application prospects in the fields of EMI shielding and protection for high-power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.									244	50	0	0	11	0	246			1613-6810	1613-6829											2021-09-23	WOS:000695745600001	34523229

Although supercapacitors (SCs) have been known for more than fifty years, only recently these devices have been considered as promising candidates to fulfil this significant technology gap. Developments in nanotechnology and manufacturing techniques applied to high-performance advanced electrode materials have accelerated progress in this fast-moving field. In this comprehensive overview article, we systematically survey the current state of art on fabrication and the corresponding electrochemical performance of electrode materials for SCs. The text covers novel carbon nanomaterials having different dimensions, such as 0D-carbon quantum dots, 1D-carbon nanostructures (carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon nano yarns and their composites) as well as 2D-carbon materials (graphene, doped-graphene, graphene derivatives and their composites). Emerging fabrication technologies are also addressed, including conventional SCs, as well as asymmetric, flexible, micro, stretchable and wearable devices. Additionally, the drawbacks for each class of electrode material, the major challenges facing the current technologies, and some of the promising research directions in this field have also been discussed.

Flexible, portable, and self-powered electronic devices based on TENGs are much desired, whereas the complex preparation processes and high cost of traditional flexible electrodes hinder their practical applications. Here, an MXene/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel TENG (MH-TENG) is presented with simple fabrication, high output performance, and versatile applications. The doping of MXene nanosheets promotes the crosslinking of the PVA hydrogel and improves the stretchability of the composite hydrogel. The MXene nanosheets also form microchannels on surfaces, which not only enhances the conductivity of the hydrogel by improving the transport of ions but also generates an extra triboelectric output via a streaming vibration potential mechanism. The measured open-circuit voltage of the MH-TENG reaches up to 230 V even in a single-electrode mode. The MH-TENG can be stretched up to 200% of the original length and demonstrates a monotonical increasing relationship between the stretchable length and the short-circuit voltage. By utilizing the MH-TENG's outstanding stretchable property and ultrahigh sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, applications in wearable movement monitoring, high-precision written stroke recognition, and low-frequency mechanical energy harvesting are demonstrated.									129	4	0	0	10	0	131			1616-301X	1616-3028											2021-07-10	WOS:000669378000001

However, it remains a big challenge to integrate multiple functions into one gel that can be widely applied in various complex scenes. Herein, a kind of multifunctional ionogels with a combination of desirable properties, including transparency, high stretchability, solvent and temperature resistance, recyclability, high conductivity, underwater self-healing ability, and underwater adhesiveness is reported. The ionogels are prepared via one-step photoinitiated polymerization of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl acrylate and acrylamide in a hydrophobic ionic liquid. The abundant noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interactions endow the ionogels with excellent mechanical strength, resilience, and rapid self-healing capability at room temperature, while the fluorine-rich polymeric matrix brings in high tolerance against water and various organic solvents, as well as tough underwater adhesion on different substrates. Wearable strain sensors based on the ionogels can sensitively detect and differentiate large body motions, such as bending of limbs, walking and jumping, as well as subtle muscle movements, such as pronunciation and pulse. It is believed that the designed ionogels will show great promises in wearable devices and ionotronics.									116	1	0	0	16	0	115			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-10-24	WOS:000706866500001	34647370

Integrating displays into textiles offers exciting opportunities for smart electronictextiles-the ultimate goal of wearable technology, poised to change the way in which we interact with electronic devices(3-6). Display textiles serve to bridge human-machine interactions(7-9), offering, for instance, a real-time communication tool for individuals with voice or speech difficulties. Electronictextiles capable of communicating(10), sensing(11,12) and supplying electricity(13,14) have been reported previously. However, textiles with functional, large-area displays have not yet been achieved, because it is challenging to obtain small illuminating unitsthat are both durable and easy to assemble over a wide area. Here we report a 6-metre-long, 25-centimetre-wide display textile containing 5 x10(5 )electroluminescent units spaced approximately 800 micrometres apart. Weaving conductive weft and luminescent warp fibres forms micrometre-scale electroluminescent units at the weft-warp contact points. The brightness between electroluminescent units deviates by less than 8 per cent and remains stable even when the textile is bent, stretched or pressed. Our display textile is flexible and breathable and withstands repeated machine-washing, making it suitable for practical applications. We showthat an integrated textile system consisting of display, keyboard and power supply can serve as a communication tool, demonstrating the system's potential within the Internet of things' in various areas, including healthcare. Our approach unifies the fabrication and function of electronic devices with textiles, and we expect that woven-fibre materials will shape the next generation of electronics.									330	30	0	0	25	0	338			0028-0836	1476-4687											2021-03-11	WOS:000627422700011	33692559

However, their highest certified efficiency of 19.9% lags behind their rigid counterparts (highest 25.7%), mainly due to defective interfaces at charge-selective contacts with perovskites on top. Here we use a mixture of two hole-selective molecules based on carbazole cores and phosphonic acid anchoring groups to form a self-assembled monolayer and bridge perovskite with a low temperature-processed NiO nanocrystal film. The hole-selective contact mitigates interfacial recombination and facilitates hole extraction. We show flexible all-perovskite tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 24.7% (certified 24.4%), outperforming all types of flexible thin-film solar cell. We also report 23.5% efficiency for larger device areas of 1.05 cm(2). The molecule-bridged interfaces enable significant bending durability of flexible all-perovskite tandem solar cells that retain their initial performance after 10,000 cycles of bending at a radius of 15 mm.The efficiency of flexible perovskite solar cells lags behind their rigid counterparts. Now, Li et al. devise a self-assembled monolayer bridged hole-selective contact with reduced defects and improved bending durability, achieving a 24.4% certified efficiency.									57	5	0	0	1	0	60			2058-7546												2022-06-20	WOS:000808446800002

Conventional sensors usually require an external power supply, with limitations such as limited lifetime and high maintenance cost. As a newly developed mechanical energy harvesting and self-powered sensing technology, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) shows great potential to overcome these limitations. Most importantly, TENGs can be fabricated using wood, paper, fibers, and polymers, which are the most frequently used materials for sports. Recent progress on the development of TENGs for the field of intelligent sports is summarized. First, the working mechanism of TENG and its association with athletic big data are introduced. Subsequently, the development of TENG-based sports sensing systems, including smart sports facilities and wearable equipment is highlighted. At last, the remaining challenges and open opportunities are also discussed.									188	12	0	0	6	0	186			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-03-24	WOS:000631784100001	33759259	
J	Ke, Tao; Zhao, Li; Fan, Xin; Gu, Haibin								Rapid self-healing, self-adhesive, anti-freezing, moisturizing, antibacterial and multi-stimuli-responsive PVA/starch/tea polyphenol-based composite conductive organohydrogel as flexible strain sensor								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				135				199	212				10.1016/j.jmst.2022.06.032							Article	FEB 1 2023	2023	The complexity of application environment stimulates the development of wearable devices based on functional hydrogels. Among all the promising performances, self-healing and self-adhesion properties are ideal for hydrogel sensors, which can guarantee good accuracy, comfort and long service life. However, it is still a challenge to achieve simultaneous self-healing and self-adhesion in different environments (in the air, underwater and at low temperatures). Herein, a feasible new strategy was successfully carried out to prepare a starch-based composite conductive organohydrogel based on the reversible borate ester bonds formed by complexing starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/tea polyphenol (TP) with borax, and multiple hydrogen-bond interactions among PVA, starch, TP and ethylene glycol (EG). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), reduced and stabilized by TP, and MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) were introduced into the cross-linking networks to endow the resulting PBSTCE organohydrogel with considerable antibacterial property and conductivity, respectively. The organohydrogel possessed rapid self-healing (HE (self-healing efficiency) = 96.07% in 90 s, both in the air and underwater, also at -20 degrees C), considerable self-adhesion (both in the air and underwater, also at -20 degrees C), remarkable stretchability (814% of elongation), anti-freezing (-20 degrees C) and moisture-retention abilities, antibacterial activity, sensitive pH/sugar-responsiveness, and plasticity. The strain sensor formed by the PBSTCE organohydrogel can not only effectively record large-scale human motions (e.g. finger/wrist/elbow bending, walking, etc.), but also accurately capture subtle motion changes (e.g. breathing, chewing, swallowing, speaking, smiling and frowning). Moreover, the self-healed organohydrogel sensor also exhibited almost invariable mechanical, electrical and sensing behaviors. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy to construct multifunctional starch-based organo-hydrogels, and promotes their efficient, stable and eco-friendly application as flexible wearable devices.

This review aims to give a systematically up-to-date overview of the Q[n]-based supramolecular organic luminescent emissions from the confined spaces triggered host-guest complexes, including the assembly fashions and the mechanisms of the macrocycle-based luminescent complexes, as well as their applications. Finally, challenges and outlook are provided.

This review covers recent approaches to not only increase the power density, rate capability, cyclic stability, etc. of supercapacitors, but also to increase their energy density using hybrid architectures. Electrodes are the most important component of a supercapacitor cell, and thus this review primarily deals with the design of hybrid supercapacitor electrodes offering a high specific capacitance, together with the elucidation of the mechanisms involved therein. The electrode performance significantly depends on the available surface area, porosity and conductivity of the component materials, and thus nano-structuring of the electrode is an elegant approach, which is discussed in the subsections for 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-dimensional hybrid materials, including some miscellaneous hybrids. The fabrication of different hybrid materials using metal oxides, metal sulfides, carbon materials, etc. with conducting polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole and their characterization are delineated from the literature data. Here, we primarily focus on the mechanism of energy storage by non-faradic electrical double-layer capacitance and faradaic pseudo-capacitance, discussing the contributions of different component mechanisms towards the total capacitance. In the hybrids, the impact of the component concentration operating via different mechanisms for charge storage on their final electrochemical performance is discussed. The specific capacitance, volumetric capacitance, charge-discharge cycles, Ragone plot, etc. of hybrid supercapacitors are described. Besides household and heavy-duty applications, the state-of-the-art future applications of supercapacitors in robotics, renewable and sustainable energy devices, wearable and self-healing supercapacitors, and biotechnology and their challenges in real-world applications with the scope of future work are elucidated.									230	3	0	0	7	0	231			2050-7488	2050-7496											2021-07-02	WOS:000674327000001

In the past few decades, a plethora of pioneering studies have been implemented to explore the cell-hydrogel matrix interactions and figure out the underlying mechanisms, paving the way to the lab-to-clinic translation of hydrogel-based therapies. In this review, we first introduced the physicochemical properties of hydrogels and their fabrication approaches concisely. Subsequently, the comprehensive description and deep discussion were elucidated, wherein the influences of different hydrogels properties on cell behaviors and cellular signaling events were highlighted. These behaviors or events included integrin clustering, focal adhesion (FA) complex accumulation and activation, cytoskeleton rearrangement, protein cyto-nuclei shuttling and activation (e.g., Yes-associated protein (YAP), catenin, etc.), cellular compartment reorganization, gene expression, and further cell biology modulation (e.g., spreading, migration, proliferation, lineage commitment, etc.). Based on them, current in vitro and in vivo hydrogel applications that mainly covered diseases models, various cell delivery protocols for tissue regeneration and disease therapy, smart drug carrier, bioimaging, biosensor, and conductive wearable/implantable biodevices, etc. were further summarized and discussed. More significantly, the clinical translation potential and trials of hydrogels were presented, accompanied with which the remaining challenges and future perspectives in this field were emphasized. Collectively, the comprehensive and deep insights in this review will shed light on the design principles of new biomedical hydrogels to understand and modulate cellular processes, which are available for providing significant indications for future hydrogel design and serving for a broad range of biomedical applications.									79	0	0	0	19	0	79			2095-9907	2059-3635											2021-12-16	WOS:000730982000001	34916490

Herein, based on synergistic hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and pi-pi interaction within regularly arranged layered porous structures, conductive carbon aerogels with cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are developed via bidirectional freezing and subsequent annealing. Benefiting from the porous architecture and high surface roughness, CNF/CNT/RGO carbon aerogels exhibit ultralow density (2.64 mg cm(-3)) and superhydrophilicity (water contact angle approximate to 0 degrees at 106 ms). The honeycomb-like ordered porous structure can efficiently transfer stress in the entire microstructure, thereby endowing carbon aerogels with high compressibility and extraordinary fatigue resistance (10,000 cycles at 50% strain). These aerogels can be assembled into compressive solid-state symmetric supercapacitors showing excellent area capacitance (109.4 mF cm(-2) at 0.4 mA cm(-2)) and superior long cycle compression performance (88% after 5000 cycles at compressive strain of 50%). Furthermore, the aerogels reveal good linear sensitivity (S = 5.61 kPa(-1)) and accurately capture human bio-signals as strain sensors. It is expected that such CNF/CNT/RGO carbon aerogels will provide a novel multifunctional platform for wearable electronics, electronic skin, and human motion monitoring.									111	4	0	0	24	0	111			1616-301X	1616-3028											2022-03-18	WOS:000764013100001

It is shown that d-p orbital hybridization between the single-atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li-S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti-bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single-atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three-dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single-atom Ti-embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single-atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1 wt.%) and a high area-sulfur loading (8 mg cm(-2)). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li-S batteries for wearable electronics.									140	7	0	0	5	0	139			0935-9648	1521-4095											2021-10-02	WOS:000700110400001	34569660

Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely adopted for self-powered respiration monitoring owing to their compelling features, such as decent biocompatibility, wearing comfort, low-cost, and high sensitivity to respiration activities in the aspect of low frequency and slight amplitude body motions. Physiological respiration behaviors and exhaled chemical regents can be precisely and continuously monitored by TENG-based respiration sensors for personalized health care. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self-powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion detection and chemical breath analysis. Concepts and approaches for acquisition of physical information associated with respiratory rate and depth are covered in the first part.

Therefore, the design and development of highly efficient EMI shielding materials are of great importance. In this work, the three-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) with regular honeycomb structure (GH) is firstly constructed by sacrificial template and freeze-drying methods. Then, the amino functionalized FeNi alloy particles (f-FeNi) are loaded on the GH skeleton followed by in-situ reduction to prepare rGH@FeNi aerogel. Finally, the rGH@FeNi/epoxy EMI shielding composites with regular honeycomb structure is obtained by vacuum-assisted impregnation of epoxy resin. Benefitting from the construction of regular honeycomb structure and electromagnetic synergistic effect, the rGH@ FeNi/epoxy composites with a low rGH@FeNi mass fraction of 2.1 wt% (rGH andf-FeNi are 1.2 and 0.9 wt%, respectively) exhibit a high EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 46 dB, which is 5.8 times of that (8 dB) for rGO/FeNi/epoxy composites with the same rGO/FeNi mass fraction.

However, building DN hydrogel-based strain sensors with excellent mechanical strength, high sensitivity, and wide operation window still remains a challenge. This paper fabricates a high-performance strain sensor from MXene-composited polyvinyl alcohol/sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose (PVA/CMC) DN hydrogel which is further reinforced by tannic acid (TA). In this PCTM (short for PVA/CMC/TA/MXene hydrogel), PVA serves as the flexible backbone, CMC mainly functions as the rigid subnetwork skeleton in the hydrogel, and naturally occurring TA further enhances the mechanical properties of the hydrogel via tight hydrogen bonds between TA and the polymer chains of PVA and CMC. MXene is utilized to build the conductive path, and its abundant hydrophilic functional groups help to achieve a uniform distribution in the hydrogel, which is beneficial for achieving high sensitivity and wide operation window. The unique multiple synergetic networks of PCTM impart promising mechanical strength (a fracture tensile strength of 1.8 MPa at a fracture strain of 740%) and high sensitivity with a wide detection window (a gauge factor of 2.9 at a strain range of 0-700%) as well as long-term durability over 3000 continuous cycles. Moreover, the sensor also exhibits accurate response to different types of human motions. As a proof of concept, a PCTM sensor is fabricated for visual detection of the pressure, suggesting its promising potentials for stretchable electronic sensors.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			2522-0128	2522-0136											2022-07-24	WOS:000826827400001

J	Zhang, Yali; Ma, Zhonglei; Ruan, Kunpeng; Gu, Junwei								Multifunctional T3C2Tx-(Fe3O4/polyimide composite films with Janus structure for outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding and superior visual thermal management								NANO RESEARCH				15	6			5601	5609				10.1007/s12274-022-4358-7					APR 2022		Article	JUN 2022	2022	Flexible multifunctional polymer-based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composite films have important application values in the fields of 5G communication technology, wearable electronic devices and artificial intelligence. In this work, Fe3O4/polyamic acid (PAA) nanofiber films are prepared by in-situ polymerization and electrospinning technology, and Ti3C2Tx-nanosheets are deposited on the surface of the Fe3O4/PAA nanofiber films via vacuum-assisted filtration. Then, Janus Ti3C2Tx-(Fe3O4/polyimide (PI)) composite films are obtained by thermal imidization. The two sides of the Janus films exhibit completely different properties. The Fe3O4/PI side has excellent hydrophobicity and insulation property, and the Ti3C2Tx side has hydrophilicity and terrific conductivity. When the mass fraction of Ti3C2Tx is 80 wt.%, the Janus Ti3C2Tx-(Fe3O4/PI) composite film has excellent EMI shielding performances and mechanical properties, with EMI shielding effectiveness, tensile strength and Young's modulus reaching 66 dB, 114.5 MPa and 5.8 GPa, respectively. At the same time, electromagnetic waves show different absorption shielding effectiveness (SEA) when incident from two sides of the Janus films. When the electromagnetic waves are incident from the Fe3O4/PI side, the SE A of the Janus film is 58 dB, much higher than that when the electromagnetic waves are incident from the Ti3C2Tx side (39 dB). In addition, the Ti3C2Tx side of the Janus Ti3C2Tx-(Fe3O4/PI) composite films also has excellent electrothermal and photothermal conversion performances. When the applied voltage is 4 V, the stable surface temperature reaches 108 degrees C; when it is irradiated by simulated sunlight with power density of 200 mW/cm(2), the stable surface temperature reaches 95 degrees C.									128	28	0	0	3	0	130			1998-0124	1998-0000											2022-04-28	WOS:000784037300006

At this stage, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology based on the triboelectrification effect and electrostatic induction has revealed great potential in various fields, including energy harvesting and sensing. Due to the improvements of configurations and materials, TENGs offer flexibility, compatibility, and stability, enabling novel auxiliary applications by harvesting and converting human mechanical energy. In this review, we first propose a concept of the TENG-based human body IoT system, consisting of energy harvesting, sensing, and interfacing, to effectively obtain, monitor and manage human motion and physical status information. Then, we present a comprehensive overview of such an IoT system from the three aforementioned focuses. Firstly, studies on human body energy harvesting are categorized according to the configurations and materials of TENGs. Secondly, based on the high sensitivity of TENGs, wearable and implantable sensors are investigated to develop the potential of human motion or physiological signal monitoring. Thirdly, the representative studies on TENG-based interfacing between human body and external electronics by using a microcontroller (MCU) are investigated based on various interactive types. Furthermore, we statistically discuss the developmental trend of TENGs in the above focused fields, and the materials suitable for TENGs to offer inspirational angles for future research. We also elaborate the proposed TENG-based human body IoT system by introducing various integrated modules with multi-functions. Finally, we systematically present promising prospects for future research directions and challenges from the perspectives of materials, power management, and communication. This review is dedicated to offering critical insights into the development of TENG-based human body IoT systems.									43	0	0	0	2	0	42			1754-5692	1754-5706											2022-08-13	WOS:000835995000001

The expanded infiltration of energy systems along with stochastic performance and high data transfer rate can bring new challenges that may severely affect precise energy management. This research work investigates the optimal and secure operation of energy systems in the presence of smart transportation systems in a correlated energy system. To achieve the maximum efficiency from the transportation system, the ideas of vehicle-to-subway (V2S) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) are utilized to develop a bilateral power flow strategy (charging/discharging or idle mode) to provide the chief charging requirements of energy systems. In this regard, the proposed model suggests a novel stochastic architecture based on unscented transformation (UT) to handle the operational uncertainties of the transportation systems when considering the correlated power generation of wind turbines (WTs). Moreover, blockchain technology is deployed to guarantee the security of data transfer within the smart city. Hence, there is a secure collaboration within all sub-systems in the smart cities, which has triggered the integrated management in this structure. The simulation results are discussed on a typical smart city test system to show the quality of the proposed model.									35	1	0	0	1	0	36			1524-9050	1558-0016											2022-02-06	WOS:000748269600001
