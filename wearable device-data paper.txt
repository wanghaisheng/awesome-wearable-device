Data were acquired on a total of 20 healthy white Caucasian subjects wearing no makeup (10 males and 10 females; age: 22.50 +/- 1.57 years; height: 173 +/- 10 cm; weight: 62.80 +/- 9.52 kg) and consisted of: i) videos of the subject's face acquired by a RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue and Depth) camera (Microsoft Kinect v2), which is a contactless device; ii) electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings acquired by a clinical Holter ECG recorder (Global Instrumentation's M12R Holter), which is a wearable device; and iii) heart-rate measurements acquired from a commercial smartwatch (Moto 360 smartwatch by Motorola), which is also a wearable device. ECG recordings were processed to extract the R-peaks position and obtain a reference indirect measurement of the heart rate. A direct measurement of the heart rate was provided by the commercial smartwatch. The dataset here presented could be useful to develop new algorithms for heart-rate detection from contactless devices and to validate contactless heart-rate estimation in comparison to reference heart rate from clinical wearable devices and to heart rate from commercial wearable devices.

Findings available in "Wearable sensors with possibilities for data exchange: Analyzing status and needs of different actors in mobile health monitoring systems" [1]. We performed an initial search of the Vandrico wearable database, and supplemented the resulting device list with an internet search. In addition to relevant meta-data (i.e. name, description, manufacturer, web-link, etc.) for each device, we also collected data on 13 attributes related to data exchange. I.e. device type, communication interface, data transfer protocol, smartphone and/or PC integration, direct integration to open health platform, 3rd platform integration with open health platform, support for health care system/middleware connection, recorded health data types, integrated sensors, medical device certification, whether or not the use can access collected data, device developer access, and device availability on the market. In addition, we grouped each device into three groups of actors that these devices are relevant for: electronic health record providers, software developers, and patients. The collected data can be used as an overview of available devices for future researchers with interest in the mobile health (mHealth) area. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

WEEE contains: (1) sensor data collected using seven wearable devices placed on four body locations (head, ear, chest, and wrist); (2) respiratory data collected with an indirect calorimeter serving as ground-truth information; (3) demographics and body composition data (e.g., fat percentage); (4) intensity level and type of physical activities, along with their corresponding metabolic equivalent of task (MET) values; and (5) answers to questionnaires about participants' physical activity level, diet, stress and sleep. Thanks to the diversity of sensors and body locations, we believe that the dataset will enable the development of novel human energy expenditure (EE) estimation techniques for a diverse set of application scenarios. EE refers to the amount of energy an individual uses to maintain body functions and as a result of physical activity. A reliable estimate of people's EE thus enables computing systems to make inferences about users' physical activity and help them promoting a healthier lifestyle.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-4463											2022-09-09	WOS:000848763100007	36050312

The data are intended to evaluate RSSI-based indoor localisation methods with activity measurements provided from a user-worn wearable device. A wrist worn accelerometer records activity signatures which are relayed to a number of receiving Access Points (AP) placed throughout the building. Upon reception of a packet, each AP measures the RSSI of the received radio signal and timestamps the accelerometer measurements. Location labels are recorded automatically using a small camera which registers fiducial floor tags as the participant carries out their normal routines in a natural way. Approximately 14 h of annotated wearable measurements are provided. A scripted fingerprint measurement is provided along with several unscripted natural living recordings, where the participant carried out a number of daily household activities which are annotated, where possible, throughout. Codes are provided to access the data and to replicate the ground-truthing procedure.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18				2052-4463											2018-08-31	WOS:000442285900003	30129934

Changes in vital signs, triggered by infections, may be detected earlier by continuous recording with a wearable device than with discrete measurements. This prospective, observational single-center feasibility study consecutively recruited pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. The WD Everion (R) was used for 14 days in each of the 20 patients on study to continuously record vital signs. Nine different vital signs and health indicators derived from them, plus six quality scores. This resulted in 274 study days (6576 hours) with 85'854 measuring points, which are a total of 772'686 measurements of vital signs and health indicators, plus 515'124 quality scores. Additionally, non-WD data like side effects, acceptability of the WD and effort for investigators were collected. In this manuscript, we present the methods of acquisition and explanations to the complete data set, which have been made publically available on open access and which can be used to study feasibility of continuous multi-parameter recording of vital signs by a WD.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2052-4463											2022-03-30	WOS:000770317500001	35301334

The first dataset is devised to benchmark techniques dealing with human behavior analysis based on multimodal inertial measurement wearable SHIMMER (TM) sensors unit during research studies "Fall Detection System for the Elderly Based on the Classification of Shimmer Sensor Prototype Data" [2] and "A novel fall detection algorithm for elderly using SHIMMER wearable sensors" [3]. The SHIMMER inertial sensor is a lightweight sensing device, incorporated with tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope and tri-axial magnetometer, mounted on the waist of the subjects. The second dataset is developed to assess the feasibility of using SHIMMER (TM) wearable third generation ECG sensors for identification of basic heart anomalies by remote ECG analysis. The experimental protocol was carried out according to the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test [ 1], which is mainly used in fall detection and fall risk assessment systems specially designed for elderly. Three daily life activities such as standing still, walking and sitting on chair and getup were performed along with fall activity in controlled environment. This dataset is available on Data in Brief Dataverse [4] and a data repository [5]. (c) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Current treatments primarily focus on managing motor symptom severity such as tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. However, as the disease progresses, treatment side-effects can emerge such as on/off periods and dyskinesia. The objective of the Levodopa Response Study was to identify whether wearable sensor data can be used to objectively quantify symptom severity in individuals with PD exhibiting motor fluctuations. Thirty-one subjects with PD were recruited from 2 sites to participate in a 4-day study. Data was collected using 2 wrist-worn accelerometers and a waist-worn smartphone. During Days 1 and 4, a portion of the data was collected in the laboratory while subjects performed a battery of motor tasks as clinicians rated symptom severity. The remaining of the recordings were performed in the home and community settings. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset collected using wearable accelerometers with specific focus on individuals with PD experiencing motor fluctuations that is made available via an open data repository.									17	1	0	0	4	0	18				2052-4463											2021-04-03	WOS:000625046500004	33547309

Dyskinesia and motor fluctuations are complications of PD medications. An objective measure of on/off time with/without dyskinesia has been sought for some time because it would facilitate the titration of medications. The objective of the dataset herein presented is to assess if wearable sensor data can be used to generate accurate estimates of limb-specific symptom severity. Nineteen subjects with PD experiencing motor fluctuations were asked to wear a total of five wearable sensors on both forearms and shanks, as well as on the lower back. Accelerometer data was collected for four days, including two laboratory visits lasting 3 to 4hours each while the remainder of the time was spent at home and in the community. During the laboratory visits, subjects performed a battery of motor tasks while clinicians rated limb-specific symptom severity. At home, subjects were instructed to use a smartphone app that guided the periodic performance of a set of motor tasks.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5				2052-4463											2021-04-03	WOS:000625046500003	33547317

Data were obtained as part of a project investigating radar-based microwave imaging for monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. The wearable device, measurement setup, and phantoms used are described. Multiple experiments were performed to get the data from three lamb brain phantoms that realistically mimic the whole-brain atrophy due to Alzheimer's disease. Microwave imaging has shown great potential for breast and brain screening due to its low cost, non-ionizing, portable, and wearable nature. Most of the studies are based on simulations with good results, but further evaluation on experimental data is required before its clinical viability. This work provides an open-source experimental dataset that can be used to evaluate novel signal processing and imaging techniques and validate simulation results. The data provide both the magnitude and phase value at each discrete frequency, making this data set useful for both time-delay and phase-shift based imaging algorithms. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

In the acquisition campaign the involved subjects car-ried out a motion task wearing the wearable sensors and reflective markers of the stereophotogrammetric system. In particular, the subjects wore in each foot a wearable sensor on the instep and a reflective marker on heel, first metatarsal head, fifth metatarsal head, and above the sensor, respec-tively. During the motion task each subject walked over an 11-meter long walkway according to its own course. The 5 subjects involved in the acquisition campaign performed 3 repetitions of the motion task, for a total of 15 trials in where the measures collected by wearable sensors and the stereophotogrammetric system can be compared.

Gathering large-scale, real-world data to track disease manifestation and long-term trajectory in this manner is quite practical and largely untapped. Researchers can assess large study cohorts using surveys and sensor-based activities that can be interspersed with participants' daily routines. In addition, this approach offers a medium for researchers to collect contextual and environmental data via device-based sensors, data aggregator frameworks, and connected wearable devices. The main aim of the SleepHealth Mobile App Study (SHMAS) was to gain a better understanding of the relationship between sleep habits and daytime functioning utilizing a novel digital health approach. Secondary goals included assessing the feasibility of a fully-remote approach to obtaining clinical characteristics of participants, evaluating data validity, and examining user retention patterns and data-sharing preferences. Here, we provide a description of data collected from 7,250 participants living in the United States who chose to share their data broadly with the study team and qualified researchers worldwide.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6				2052-4463											2020-12-22	WOS:000596315200002	33247114

In details, data includes 4 simulated falls forward (falling on knees ending up lying, ending in lateral position, ending up lying, ending up lying with recovery), 4 backward (falling sitting ending up lying, ending in lateral position, ending up lying, ending up lying with recovery), 2 lateral right (ending up lying, ending up lying with recovery), 2 lateral left (ending up lying, ending up lying with recovery), and 1 syncope. Simulated ADL are: lying on a bed then standing; walking a few meters; sitting on a chair then standing; go up or down three steps; and standing after picking something. Data were acquired using a MARG sensor, a wearable multisensory device tied to the subject's waist, that recorded time-variations of the subject's acceleration and orientation (expressed through the yaw, pitch and roll angles). These data can be useful in the development and test of algorithms to automatically identify and classify fall events. Fall detection systems are particularly useful when a subject is alone and not able to stand up after a fall, since an automatic alarm can be sent remotely to receive proper help.

The dataset was used to derive predictive models of how occupants operate room air-conditioning units. Second, we tracked 23 students and 6 teachers in a 4-week cross-sectional study En-Gage, using wearable sensors to log physiological data, as well as daily surveys to query the occupants' thermal comfort, learning engagement, emotions and seating behaviours. Overall, the combined dataset could be used to analyse the relationships between indoor/outdoor climates and students' behaviours/mental states on campus, which provide opportunities for the future design of intelligent feedback systems to benefit both students and staff.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2052-4463											2022-06-13	WOS:000805200300002	35654857

We designed the study to investigate the use of off-the-shelf wearable and environmental sensors to understand individual-specific constructs such as job performance, interpersonal interaction, and well-being of hospital workers over time in their natural day-to-day job settings. We collected behavioral and physiological data from n = 212 participants through Internet-of-Things Bluetooth data hubs, wearable sensors (including a wristband, a biometrics-tracking garment, a smartphone, and an audio-feature recorder), together with a battery of surveys to assess personality traits, behavioral states, job performance, and well-being over time. Besides the default use of the data set, we envision several novel research opportunities and potential applications, including multi-modal and multi-task behavioral modeling, authentication through biometrics, and privacy-aware and privacy-preserving machine learning.									14	0	0	0	4	0	14				2052-4463											2020-11-06	WOS:000582128800003	33067468

However, many steps are still needed to reach the performance of optoelectronic systems to compute kinematic parameters. The proposed dataset has been established on 10 asymptomatic adults. Participants were asked to walk at different speeds on a 10-meters walkway in a laboratory and to perform different movements such as squats or knee flexion/extension tasks. Three-dimensional trajectories of 69 reflective markers placed according to a conventional full body markerset, acceleration and angular velocity signals of 8 inertial sensors, pressure signals of 2 insoles, 3D ground reaction forces and moments obtained from 3 force plates were simultaneously recorded. Eight calculated virtual markers related to joint centers were also added to the dataset. This dataset contains a total of 337 trials including static and dynamic tasks for each participant. Its purpose is to enable comparisons between various motion capture systems and stimulate the development of new methods for gait analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-4463											2023-04-21	WOS:000961045100001	36997555

PHYTMO includes the recording of 30 volunteers, aged between 20 and 70 years old. A total amount of 6 exercises and 3 gait variations were recorded. The volunteers performed two series with a minimum of 8 repetitions in each one. PHYTMO includes magneto-inertial data, together with a highly accurate location and orientation in the 3D space provided by the optical system. The files were stored in CSV format to ensure its usability. The aim of this dataset is the availability of data for two main purposes: the analysis of techniques for the identification and evaluation of exercises using inertial sensors and the validation of inertial sensor-based algorithms for human motion monitoring. Furthermore, the database stores enough data to apply Machine Learning-based algorithms. The participants' age range is large enough to establish age-based metrics for the exercises evaluation or the study of differences in motions between different groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-4463											2022-06-15	WOS:000805770400003	35661743

In this study, we examined the impact of anxiety-inducing videos on biosignals, particularly electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration (RES) signals, that were collected using a portable device. Two psychological scales (Beck Anxiety Inventory and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) were used to assess overall anxiety before induction. The data were collected at Simon Fraser University from participants aged 18-56, all of whom were healthy at the time. The ECG and RES signals were collected simultaneously while participants continuously watched video clips that stimulated anxiety-inducing (negative experience) and non-anxiety-inducing events (positive experience). The ECG and RES signals were recorded simultaneously at 500 Hz. The final dataset consisted of psychological scores and physiological signals from 19 participants (14 males and 5 females) who watched eight video clips. This dataset can be used to explore the instantaneous relationship between ECG and RES waveforms and anxiety-inducing video clips to uncover and evaluate the latent characteristic information contained in these biosignals.

Each cardiorespiratory dataset consists of demographic info (gender, age, weight, height, smoking habit, alcohol consumption and weekly training rate), cardiorespiratory signals (electrocardiogram, heart-rate series, RR-interval series and breathing-rate series) and training notes. Demographic info was collected by survey. Cardiorespiratory signals were acquired through the chest strap BioHarness 3.0 by Zephyr. Eventually, training notes including the sport-dependent training protocol, were manually annotated. Sport Database may be useful to support: 1) the investigation of cardiorespiratory system adaptations to different types of physical exercise; 2) the development of automatic algorithms finalized to real-time health monitoring of athletes and preventive identification of subjects at increased risk of sport-related sudden cardiac death; and, 3) clinical testing of the BioHarness 3.0 by Zephyr. Further acquisitions could involve other sports, other cardiovascular signals and/or parameters, data from different biological systems, and other acquisition devices. (c) 2019 The Author(s).

Data from wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), can be analyzed with machine learning to perform gait analysis in real-world environments. This database provides data from thirty participants (fifteen males and fifteen females, 23.5 +/- 4.2 years, 169.3 +/- 21.5 cm, 70.9 +/- 13.9 kg) who wore six IMUs while walking on nine outdoor surfaces with self-selected speed (16.4 +/- 4.2 seconds per trial). This is the first publicly available database focused on capturing gait patterns of typical real-world environments, such as grade (up-, down-, and cross-slopes), regularity (paved, uneven stone, grass), and stair negotiation (up and down). As such, the database contains data with only subtle differences between conditions, allowing for the development of robust analysis techniques capable of detecting small, but significant changes in gait mechanics. With analysis code provided, we anticipate that this database will provide a foundation for research that explores machine learning applications for mobile sensing and real-time recognition of subtle gait adaptations.									28	0	0	0	12	0	28				2052-4463											2020-08-06	WOS:000552006300002	32641740

The SHiB is a low cost and easily deployable kit designed to collect data from a wrist-worn wearable in a home environment. The data presented is intended to evaluate room level indoor localization methods. The wearable device registers tri-axial accelerometer measurements which are sampled and transmitted as the payload of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet. Four receiving gateways, each placed in a different room throughout a typical residential house, extract the accelerometer data and determine a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for each received BLE packet. RSSI values can represent propagation losses due to distance or shadowing between the wearable transmitter and the gateway receiver.The dataset is presented in two parts. The first is composed of four calibration or training sequences, carried out by ten participants to offer ground truth calibrations for four rooms in the house. We refer to the calibration phase as the steps taken to gather training data. The calibration procedure was designed to be as straight-forward as possible, to allow a participant to adequately train the SHiB system without supervision. Ten participants each carried out a straight forward calibration procedure once, with four participants carrying out the calibration twice, on different occasions. One participant carried out the calibration on a third occasion.The second part of the data consists of a free-living experiment that was carried out over a period of five and a half hours starting at 7.37 a.m. Of this, one and a half hours of measurements are recorded within a room containing a gateway, where one participant carried out activities of daily living while their ground-truth location was accurately annotated within each room with a gateway present. The calibration data can be used as a training scheme and the living data as a test scenario.The dataset can be found at https://github.com/rymc/a-dataset-for-indoor-localization-using-a-smart-home-in-a-box (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, the accurate and automatic assessment of activities of daily living (ADLs) through machine learning algorithms is still a challenge, especially due to limited availability of realistic datasets to train and test such algorithms. The dataset contains data from 52 participants in total (26 women, and 26 men). The data for these participants was collected in two phases: 33 participants initially, and 19 further participants later on. Participants performed up to 5 repetitions of 24 different ADLs. Firstly, we provide an annotated description of the dataset collected by wearing a wrist-worn measurement device, Empatica E4. Secondly, we describe the methodology of the data collection and the real context in which participants performed the selected activities. Finally, we present some examples of recent and relevant target applications where our dataset can be used, namely lifelogging, behavioural analysis and measurement device evaluation. The authors consider the dissemination of this dataset can highly benefit the research community, and specially those involved in the recognition of ADLs, and/or in the removal of cues that reveal identity.

Stress detection has gained increased attention in recent years, mainly because early stress detection can help individuals better manage health to minimize the negative impacts of long-term stress exposure. This paper provides a unique stress detection dataset created in a natural working environment in a hospital. This dataset is a collection of biometric data of nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Studying stress in a work environment is complex due to many social, cultural, and psychological factors in dealing with stressful conditions. Therefore, we captured both the physiological data and associated context pertaining to the stress events. We monitored specific physiological variables such as electrodermal activity, Heart Rate, and skin temperature of the nurse subjects. A periodic smartphone-administered survey also captured the contributing factors for the detected stress events. A database containing the signals, stress events, and survey responses is publicly available on Dryad.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2052-4463											2022-06-14	WOS:000804762200004	35650267

Additionally, several studies have proposed technologies and algorithms to analyse the flexion-relaxation phenomenon, which is defined by myoelectric silence that occurs when the subject's torso exceeds a certain flexion angle. Before participating in the flexion-relaxation test, subjects involved in the data collection underwent medical examinations, in which their physical condition, perceived pain, and level of disability were reported in their anamnesis. During the flexion relaxation test, which was conducted with 25 subjects with and without low back pain, subjects wore four surface electromyography electrodes positioned over the back muscles, as well as an inertial sensor to estimate trunk inclination.

However, open challenges still limit its widespread use, especially in low-cost systems. Most solutions are either expensive commercial products or lower performance ad-hoc systems. Moreover, few datasets are available for the development of complete and general solutions. This work presents 2 datasets, with low-cost and high-end Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity(MARG) sensor data. Provides data for the complete inertial pose pipeline analysis, starting from raw data, sensor-to-segment calibration, multi-sensor fusion, skeleton-kinematics, to complete Human pose. Contains data from 21 and 10 participants, respectively, performing 6 types of sequences, presenting high variability and complex dynamics with almost complete range-of-motion. Amounts to 3.5 M samples, synchronized with a ground-truth inertial motion capture system. Presents a method to evaluate data quality. This database may contribute to develop novel algorithms for each pipeline's processing steps, with applications in inertial pose estimation algorithms, human movement forecasting, and motion assessment in industrial or rehabilitation settings. All data and code to process and analyze the complete pipeline is freely available.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-4463											2022-10-13	WOS:000862416100001	36180479

Therefore, we performed a systematic search to identify observational studies, including surveillance systems, that collected accelerometry-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior among adults. We performed a search using PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus for studies published on or before June 1, 2021. After screening 5686 abstracts and 1027 full text articles, we included 155 unique studies that collected accelerometry on at least 500 adults 18 years or older. Most studies used one accelerometer (n = 146), although eight studies used two accelerometers and one study used four accelerometers. The country of data collection, age range, and accelerometer characteristics were abstracted and checked by a second reviewer. These datasets summarizing relevant observational studies of adults can be a resource to researchers seeking to identify data sources for accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary be-havior from around the world.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-3409												2023-04-14	WOS:000958446300001	36923018

Data concern two different datasets: long-term hygrothermal histories collected in two specific positions of the town object of the research, and three environmental transects collected following on foot the same designed path at three different time of the same day, i.e. during a heat wave event in summer. The short-term monitoring campaign is carried out by means of an innovative wearable weather station specifically developed by the authors and settled upon a bike helmet. Data provided within the short-term monitoring campaign are analysed by computing the apparent temperature, a direct indicator of human thermal comfort in the outdoors. All provided environmental data are geo-referenced. These data are used in order to examine the intra-urban microclimate variability. Outcomes from both long- and short-term monitoring campaigns allow to confirm the existing correlation between the urban forms and functionalities and the corresponding local microclimate conditions, also generated by anthropogenic actions. In detail, higher fractions of built surfaces are associated to generally higher temperatures as emerges by comparing the two long-term air temperature data series, i.e. temperature collected at point 1 is higher than temperature collated at point 2 for the 75% of the monitored period with an average of +2.8 degrees C. Furthermore, gathered environmental transects demonstrate the high variability of the main environmental parameters below the Urban Canopy. Diversification of the urban thermal behaviour leads to a computed apparent temperature range in between 33.2 degrees C and 46.7 degrees C at 2 p.m. along the monitoring path. Reuse of these data may be helpful for further investigating interesting correlations among urban configuration, anthropogenic actions and microclimate variables affecting outdoor comfort. Additionally, the proposed dataset may be compared to other similar datasets collected in other urban contexts around the world. Finally, it can be compared to other monitoring methodologies such as weather stations and satellite measurements available in the location at the same time. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The EEG data is available in.mat formatted files containing the EEG signal values structured in two-dimensional (2D) matrices, with channel data and trigger information in rows, and samples in columns (having a sampling rate of 250Hz). Twenty-nine female survivors of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, underwent a psychological assessment before and after an intervention aimed at reducing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. Three measures of trauma and four measures of wellbeing were assessed using empirically validated standardised assessments. The pre- and post-intervention psychometric data were analysed using non-parametric statistical methods and the post-intervention data were further evaluated according to diagnostic assessment rules to determine clinically relevant improvements for each group. The participants were assigned to a control group (CG, n = 9), a motor-imagery group (MI, n = 10), and a neurofeedback group (NF, n = 10). Participants in the latter two groups received Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based training as a treatment intervention over a sixteen-day period, between the pre- and post-clinical interviews. The training involved presenting feedback visually via a videogame, based on real-time analysis of the EEG recorded data during the BCI-based treatment session. Participants were asked to regulate (NF) or intentionally modulate (MI) brain activity to affect/control the game. (C) 2022 The Authors.

PloS one				16	4			e0247903	e0247903				10.1371/journal.pone.0247903							Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study	2021	2021	Recognition of early signs of deterioration in postoperative course could be improved by continuous monitoring of vital parameters. Wearable sensors could enable this by wireless transmission of vital signs. A novel accelerometer-based device, called Healthdot, has been designed to be worn on the skin to measure the two key vital parameters respiration rate (RespR) and heart rate (HeartR). The goal of this study is to assess the reliability of heart rate and respiration rate measured by the Healthdot in comparison to the gold standard, the bedside patient monitor, during the postoperative period in bariatric patients. Data were collected in a consecutive group of 30 patients who agreed to wear the device after their primary bariatric procedure. Directly after surgery, a Healthdot was attached on the patients' left lower rib. Vital signs measured by the accelerometer based Healthdot were compared to vital signs collected with the gold standard patient monitor for the period that the patient stayed at the post-anesthesia care unit. Over all patients, a total of 22 hours of vital signs obtained by the Healthdot were recorded simultaneously with the bedside patient monitor data. 87.5% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 beats per minute for HeartR and 92.3% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 respirations per minute for RespR. The Healthdot can be used to accurately derive heart rate and respiration rate in postbariatric patients. Wireless continuous monitoring of key vital signs has the potential to contribute to earlier recognition of complications in postoperative patients. Future studies should focus on the ability to detect patient deterioration in low-care environments and at home after discharge from the hospital.									10	0	0	0	2	0	13				1932-6203											2021-09-07	MEDLINE:33909642	33909642

We collected data from 43 participants who watched short film clips eliciting nine discrete emotions: amusement, awe, enthusiasm, liking, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Three wearables were used to record physiological data: EEG, BVP (2x), HR, EDA, SKT, ACC (3x), and GYRO (2x); in parallel with the upper-body videos. After each film clip, participants completed two types of self-reports: (1) related to nine discrete emotions and (2) three affective dimensions: valence, arousal, and motivation. The obtained data facilitates various ER approaches, e.g., multimodal ER, EEG- vs. cardiovascular-based ER, discrete to dimensional representation transitions. The technical validation indicated that watching film clips elicited the targeted emotions. It also supported signals' high quality.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2052-4463											2022-04-22	WOS:000779746300002	35393434

Most existing emotion datasets do not support studying idiosyncratic emotions arising in the wild as they were collected in constrained environments. Therefore, studying emotions in the context of social interactions requires a novel dataset, and K-EmoCon is such a multimodal dataset with comprehensive annotations of continuous emotions during naturalistic conversations. The dataset contains multimodal measurements, including audiovisual recordings, EEG, and peripheral physiological signals, acquired with off-the-shelf devices from 16 sessions of approximately 10-minute long paired debates on a social issue. Distinct from previous datasets, it includes emotion annotations from all three available perspectives: self, debate partner, and external observers. Raters annotated emotional displays at intervals of every 5 seconds while viewing the debate footage, in terms of arousal-valence and 18 additional categorical emotions. The resulting K-EmoCon is the first publicly available emotion dataset accommodating the multiperspective assessment of emotions during social interactions.									30	0	0	0	5	0	30				2052-4463											2020-10-06	WOS:000571812600006	32901038
